    - [ ] To shut down the computer system gracefully.
    - [ ] To compile user code into machine code.
    <br>

2.  **The separation between User Mode and Kernel Mode in an OS is primarily a hardware-enforced mechanism for:**
    - [ ] Improving the performance of I/O operations.
    - [ ] Allowing multiple users to log in simultaneously.
    - [ ] Protecting the OS and kernel data structures from being corrupted by user programs.
    - [ ] Managing the file system.
    <br>

    - [ ] Does not have a kernel.
    - [ ] Is primarily designed for user convenience and a rich UI.
    - [ ] Guarantees that tasks will be completed within a specific, deterministic time constraint.
    <br>

4.  **In Linux, what does the command `chmod 754 myfile.txt` do?**
    - [ ] It grants read, write, and execute permissions to the owner; read and execute to the group; and read-only to others.
    - [ ] It grants read and write to the owner; read and execute to the group; and write-only to others.
    - [ ] It grants full permissions to everyone.
    - [ ] It changes the ownership of the file to the user "chmod".
    <br>

5.  **An "interrupt" is a signal to the processor, typically generated by a hardware device, indicating:**
    - [ ] The program has encountered a fatal error.
    - [ ] The system is running low on memory.
    - [ ] A user has logged out.
    - [ ] An event that needs immediate attention from the OS kernel.
    <br>

6.  **What is the function of the `pipe` (`|`) operator in a Linux shell command like `ls -l | grep .txt`?**
    - [ ] It saves the output of the `ls -l` command to a file named `grep.txt`.
    - [ ] It runs both commands simultaneously in the background.
    - [ ] It redirects the standard output of the `ls -l` command to be the standard input of the `grep .txt` command.
    - [ ] It searches for the string `|` within the `ls -l` output.
    <br>

7.  **What does the term "hardware dependent" mean in the context of an OS?**
    - [ ] The OS can only run on hardware from a single manufacturer.
    - [ ] The OS kernel must be specifically written and compiled to work with the underlying CPU architecture and device controllers.
    - [ ] The OS requires a specific type of monitor and keyboard.
    - [ ] The OS performance depends on the quality of the hardware.
    <br>

8.  **In a Linux file system, the `..` entry in a directory refers to:**
    - [ ] The root directory.
    - [ ] The current directory.
    - [ ] The user's home directory.
    - [ ] The parent directory.
    <br>

    - [ ] Running application software like web browsers.
    - [ ] Managing the computer's resources (CPU, memory, devices) and providing services to applications.
    - [ ] Compiling source code.
    <br>

10. **A user's default shell is determined by which system variable or file?**

    - [ ] The user's entry in the `/etc/passwd` file.
    - [ ] The `PS1` system variable.
    <br>

**Answer Key (1-10)**
1.  **Answer:** ||(B) A system call is the mechanism through which a user-mode program requests a privileged operation from the kernel, such as file I/O or process creation.||
2.  **Answer:** ||(C) The dual-mode operation (User/Kernel) is a fundamental protection mechanism. Critical operations can only be performed in kernel mode, preventing user programs from directly accessing hardware or interfering with the OS.||
3.  **Answer:** ||(D) The defining characteristic of an RTOS is not raw speed, but predictability and determinism. It's crucial for systems like flight controls or medical devices where a missed deadline is a catastrophic failure.||
4.  **Answer:** ||(A) The numbers represent permissions for Owner, Group, and Others. 7 is `rwx` (4+2+1), 5 is `r-x` (4+0+1), and 4 is `r--` (4+0+0).||
5.  **Answer:** ||(D) When a device (like a keyboard or disk controller) finishes an operation, it sends an interrupt to the CPU. This causes the CPU to suspend its current task and execute a special kernel function called an Interrupt Service Routine to handle the event.||
6.  **Answer:** ||(C) The pipe operator is a powerful mechanism for chaining commands together. It creates a pipeline where the output of one command becomes the input for the next.||
7.  **Answer:** ||(B) A significant portion of the OS, especially the kernel and device drivers, must interact directly with the hardware. Therefore, it needs to be compiled for a specific CPU instruction set (like x86 or ARM) and include drivers for that machine's specific hardware components.||
8.  **Answer:** ||(D) In the file system hierarchy, `.` represents the current directory and `..` represents the parent directory, allowing for relative navigation.||
9.  **Answer:** ||(C) The kernel is the core of the OS. It manages all hardware resources and provides fundamental services upon which all other software runs.||
10. **Answer:** ||(C) The last field in a user's line in the `/etc/passwd` file specifies the path to their default login shell (e.g., `/bin/bash` or `/bin/zsh`).||
<br>

### **Topic 2: Shell Programming & Processes (Sessions 3-5)**

11. **In a shell script, what does `$#` represent?**
    - [ ] The name of the script itself.
    - [ ] The process ID of the current shell.
    - [ ] The exit status of the last executed command.
    - [ ] The total number of command-line arguments passed to the script.
    <br>

12. **What is the key difference between a process and a thread?**
    - [ ] Processes can run concurrently, but threads cannot.
    - [ ] A process has its own dedicated memory space, while threads within the same process share memory space.
    - [ ] Threads are managed by the OS, while processes are managed by the application.
    - [ ] Creating a new thread is more resource-intensive than creating a new process.
    <br>

13. **Which process scheduling algorithm can suffer from "starvation," where a low-priority process may never get to run?**
    - [ ] First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
    - [ ] Round Robin (RR)
    - [ ] Strict Priority-Based Scheduling
    - [ ] Shortest Job First (SJF)
    <br>

14. **In shell scripting, what is the purpose of the `test` command or the `[` `]` brackets?**
    - [ ] To execute a command in a subshell.
    - [ ] To create an array.
    - [ ] To evaluate a conditional expression, typically within an `if` statement.
    - [ ] To define a function.
    <br>

15. **A process is in a state where it has completed execution but its parent process has not yet read its exit status. What is this process called?**
    - [ ] Orphan Process
    - [ ] Sleeping Process
    - [ ] Zombie Process
    - [ ] Daemon Process
    <br>

16. **Which process scheduler is responsible for selecting which process from the ready queue will be allocated the CPU next?**
    - [ ] The Long-Term Scheduler
    - [ ] The Medium-Term Scheduler
    - [ ] The Short-Term Scheduler (or CPU Scheduler)
    - [ ] The I/O Scheduler
    <br>

17. **What is Belady's Anomaly?**
    - [ ] A phenomenon where increasing the number of CPU cores decreases overall system throughput.
    - [ ] A situation in priority scheduling where a high-priority task is blocked by a low-priority task.
    - [ ] A phenomenon where increasing the number of page frames results in an increase in the number of page faults for certain memory access patterns.
    - [ ] The state where a process is starved of resources.
    <br>

18. **In Unix-like systems, which system call is used to create a new process?**
    - [ ] `exec()`
    - [ ] `create()`
    - [ ] `wait()`
    - [ ] `fork()`
    <br>

19. **What is the difference between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling?**
    - [ ] Preemptive scheduling can be interrupted by system calls, while non-preemptive cannot.
    - [ ] In preemptive scheduling, the OS can forcibly interrupt a running process to give the CPU to another process. In non-preemptive scheduling, a process runs until it voluntarily relinquishes the CPU.
    - [ ] Non-preemptive scheduling is used in multi-core systems, while preemptive is for single-core systems.
    - [ ] Preemptive scheduling only applies to kernel-level threads.
    <br>

20. **What does the `exec` family of system calls do?**
    - [ ] It creates a new child process that is a copy of the parent.
    - [ ] It replaces the current process image with a new program.
    - [ ] It causes the parent process to wait for a child process to terminate.
    - [ ] It terminates the current process.
    <br>

**Answer Key (11-20)**
11. **Answer:** ||(D) `$#` is a special shell variable that holds the count of positional parameters (command-line arguments) passed to the script. `$0` is the script name, and `$?` is the exit status.||
12. **Answer:** ||(B) This is the fundamental difference. Processes are isolated from each other by the OS. Threads within a process share the same memory (heap), which makes communication between them fast but also introduces the need for synchronization.||
13. **Answer:** ||(C) In a strict, non-aging priority scheduler, if there is a continuous stream of high-priority tasks, a low-priority task might be postponed indefinitely and never get CPU time. This is known as starvation.||
14. **Answer:** ||(C) The `test` command (and its syntactic sugar `[ ... ]`) is used to check file types, compare strings, and compare numbers. Its exit status (`0` for true, `1` for false) is then used by control flow statements like `if` and `while`.||
15. **Answer:** ||(C) A zombie process is a terminated process that remains in the process table because its parent has not yet called `wait()` to collect its exit status. It consumes a process table entry but no other resources.||
16. **Answer:** ||(C) The Short-Term Scheduler runs very frequently to select the next process to run from the ready queue. The Long-Term Scheduler determines which processes are admitted into the system from the job pool.||
17. **Answer:** ||(C) Belady's Anomaly is a counter-intuitive result that can occur with some page replacement algorithms, most notably FIFO, where giving a process more memory can, in some specific cases, lead to worse performance.||
18. **Answer:** ||(D) The `fork()` system call creates a new child process which is an almost identical copy of the parent process. This is the standard mechanism for process creation in Unix/Linux.||
19. **Answer:** ||(B) This is the core distinction. Preemptive schedulers (used by all modern OSes like Windows, Linux, macOS) use a timer interrupt to forcibly take the CPU away from a process, ensuring fair sharing and system responsiveness.||
20. **Answer:** ||(B) After a `fork()`, the child process often calls `exec()` to replace its own memory space and code with that of a new program. This `fork-exec` model is the standard way to launch new applications.||
<br>

### **Topic 3: Memory Management & Virtual Memory (Sessions 6-8)**

21. **What is the difference between internal and external fragmentation?**
    - [ ] Internal fragmentation occurs within a process's address space, while external fragmentation occurs in the kernel.
    - [ ] Internal fragmentation is when allocated memory is slightly larger than the requested memory, leading to unused space *inside* an allocated block. External fragmentation is when free memory is scattered in small, non-contiguous blocks.
    - [ ] External fragmentation is a more serious problem than internal fragmentation.
    - [ ] Paging solves external fragmentation, while segmentation solves internal fragmentation.
    <br>

22. **In a memory allocation scheme, which algorithm places a process in the smallest available hole that is large enough?**
    - [ ] First-Fit
    - [ ] Best-Fit
    - [ ] Worst-Fit
    - [ ] Buddy System
    <br>

23. **What problem does "compaction" solve?**
    - [ ] Internal fragmentation
    - [ ] External fragmentation
    - [ ] Page faults
    - [ ] Thrashing
    <br>

24. **What is the primary purpose of a Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)?**
    - [ ] To store frequently used instructions.
    - [ ] To act as a cache for the page table to speed up virtual-to-physical address translation.
    - [ ] To store pages that have been swapped out to disk.
    - [ ] To manage the allocation of memory frames.
    <br>

25. **"Demand paging" is a memory management technique where:**
    - [ ] A process demands a specific amount of memory from the OS upon startup.
    - [ ] Pages are brought into main memory from the disk only when they are needed (i.e., on a page fault).
    - [ ] The user can demand that certain pages are never swapped out.
    - [ ] The OS pre-loads all pages of a process into memory before it starts.
    <br>

26. **What does the "dirty bit" associated with a page in a page table signify?**
    - [ ] The page has been accessed recently.
    - [ ] The page is corrupted and needs to be reloaded.
    - [ ] The page has been modified since it was loaded into memory.
    - [ ] The page is read-only.
    <br>

27. **Which page replacement algorithm replaces the page that will not be used for the longest period of time in the future?**
    - [ ] FIFO (First-In, First-Out)
    - [ ] LRU (Least Recently Used)
    - [ ] Optimal Page Replacement
    - [ ] LFU (Least Frequently Used)
    <br>

28. **What is "thrashing" in an operating system?**
    - [ ] A situation where the system spends more time swapping pages in and out of memory than doing actual productive work.
    - [ ] A security attack that overwhelms the OS with system calls.
    - [ ] The process of cleaning up fragmented memory.
    - [ ] A high rate of context switching between processes.
    <br>

29. **The logical address generated by the CPU is divided into two parts for paging. They are:**
    - [ ] Page number and Segment number
    - [ ] Base address and Limit
    - [ ] Page number and Page offset
    - [ ] Segment number and Offset
    <br>

30. **What is the key difference between paging and segmentation?**
    - [ ] Paging divides the address space into fixed-size blocks, while segmentation divides it into variable-size, logical blocks.
    - [ ] Paging suffers from external fragmentation, while segmentation suffers from internal fragmentation.
    - [ ] Paging requires special hardware support, but segmentation does not.
    - [ ] Paging is used for virtual memory, while segmentation is for main memory.
    <br>

**Answer Key (21-30)**
21. **Answer:** ||(B) This is the core definition. Internal fragmentation is wasted space *within* an allocated block. External fragmentation is when the total free space is sufficient, but it's not contiguous, so it cannot satisfy a large request.||
22. **Answer:** ||(B) Best-Fit searches the entire list of free holes to find the one that is the smallest but still large enough. This can leave very small, often unusable holes.||
23. **Answer:** ||(B) Compaction is the process of shuffling memory contents to place all free memory together in one large block. It is a solution to external fragmentation but is very time-consuming.||
24. **Answer:** ||(B) Accessing the page table (which is in main memory) for every memory reference would be very slow. The TLB is a small, fast hardware cache that stores recent virtual-to-physical address translations to speed up this process.||
25. **Answer:** ||(B) This is the fundamental principle of virtual memory. It allows a process to start with none of its pages in RAM. A page is only loaded from the disk when the CPU tries to access it, triggering a page fault.||
26. **Answer:** ||(C) The dirty bit (or modify bit) is set by the hardware whenever a write operation occurs on a page. This is a crucial optimization: if a page is to be replaced and its dirty bit is not set, the OS knows it doesn't need to write it back to the disk because the disk copy is still valid.||
27. **Answer:** ||(C) The Optimal algorithm provides the best possible performance and is used as a benchmark for comparison. However, it is impossible to implement in practice because it requires knowledge of the future. LRU is an approximation of this.||
28. **Answer:** ||(A) Thrashing occurs in a system with heavy memory over-commitment. Processes do not have enough frames, so they immediately fault for another page, which replaces a page they will need again shortly. This leads to a constant cycle of paging and very low CPU utilization.||
29. **Answer:** ||(C) The CPU generates a virtual address consisting of a page number (p) and an offset (d). The MMU uses the page number `p` as an index into the page table to find the frame number `f`, and the final physical address is `f + d`.||
30. **Answer:** ||(A) This is the primary distinction. Paging is transparent to the programmer and uses fixed-size pages. Segmentation is visible to the programmer and uses logical segments of varying sizes (e.g., code segment, data segment, stack segment).||
<br>

### **Topic 4: Deadlock & Concurrency (Session 9)**

31. **Which of the following is NOT one of the four necessary conditions for a deadlock to occur?**
    - [ ] Mutual Exclusion
    - [ ] Hold and Wait
    - [ ] Starvation
    - [ ] Circular Wait
    <br>

32. **What is a "semaphore"?**
    - [ ] A hardware mechanism for preventing deadlocks.
    - [ ] A special type of lock that can only be held by one thread at a time.
    - [ ] A synchronization primitive that is essentially an integer counter, controlled by `wait()` (decrement) and `signal()` (increment) operations.
    - [ ] A condition where a process is indefinitely postponed.
    <br>

33. **The "Producer-Consumer" problem is a classic synchronization problem that deals with:**
    - [ ] Preventing two processes from producing data at the same time.
    - [ ] Ensuring the producer process does not try to add data to a full buffer and the consumer process does not try to remove data from an empty buffer.
    - [ ] Deciding which consumer gets the data first.
    - [ ] Preventing deadlock between producers and consumers.
    <br>

34. **What is the difference between a mutex and a binary semaphore?**
    - [ ] A mutex can be acquired multiple times by the same thread, while a semaphore cannot.
    - [ ] A semaphore is faster than a mutex.
    - [ ] In principle, a mutex should only be released by the thread that acquired it, while a semaphore can be signaled by any thread.
    - [ ] There is no difference; they are two names for the same concept.
    <br>

35. **The Banker's Algorithm is a method for:**
    - [ ] Deadlock prevention.
    - [ ] Deadlock detection.
    - [ ] Deadlock avoidance.
    - [ ] Deadlock recovery.
    <br>

36. **"Starvation" is different from "deadlock" because:**
    - [ ] Starvation involves only one process, while deadlock involves at least two.
    - [ ] In starvation, a process is blocked indefinitely, but it is theoretically possible for it to run eventually. In deadlock, the processes are in a state from which they can never recover.
    - [ ] Starvation is a hardware problem, while deadlock is a software problem.
    - [ ] Deadlock can be solved with semaphores, but starvation cannot.
    <br>

### **Topic 5: Software Engineering & SDLC (Sessions 1-5 of SDM)**

37. **Which phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) involves gathering and analyzing what the system is supposed to do?**
    - [ ] Design
    - [ ] Implementation
    - [ ] Requirements Engineering
    - [ ] Testing
    <br>

38. **In software design, what do "cohesion" and "coupling" refer to?**
    - [ ] Cohesion refers to the testing phase, and coupling refers to the deployment phase.
    - [ ] A good design aims for low cohesion and high coupling.
    - [ ] Cohesion is a measure of how strongly related the elements within a single module are. Coupling is a measure of how dependent different modules are on each other.
    - [ ] Cohesion and coupling are concepts related only to object-oriented design.
    <br>

39. **The Waterfall Model of software development is best described as:**
    - [ ] An iterative and incremental model.
    - [ ] A flexible model that easily accommodates changes in requirements.
    - [ ] A linear, sequential model where each phase must be completed before the next one begins.
    - [ ] A model focused on rapid prototyping.
    <br>

40. **What is a key characteristic of good software design?**
    - [ ] Low cohesion and high coupling.
    - [ ] High cohesion and low coupling.
    - [ ] A single, monolithic module.
    - [ ] The use of global variables for all data.
    <br>

**Answer Key (31-40)**
31. **Answer:** ||(C) Starvation is a possible outcome of certain scheduling or resource allocation policies, but it is not a necessary condition for deadlock. The four conditions are Mutual Exclusion, Hold and Wait, No Preemption, and Circular Wait.||
32. **Answer:** ||(C) A semaphore is a generalized synchronization tool. A counting semaphore allows a certain number of threads (its count) to access a resource concurrently. A binary semaphore (count=1) acts like a mutex.||
33. **Answer:** ||(B) This is the core synchronization constraint. The producer must wait if the shared buffer is full, and the consumer must wait if it is empty. This is typically implemented using semaphores or monitors.||
34. **Answer:** ||(C) This is the key conceptual difference. A mutex is designed to protect a resource, and the lock has an "owner" (the thread that acquired it). A semaphore is a more general signaling mechanism; one thread can `signal` (increment) it to wake up another thread that is in a `wait` state.||
35. **Answer:** ||(C) Deadlock avoidance involves the system having prior information about the maximum resource needs of each process and making allocation decisions to ensure it never enters an unsafe state that could lead to a deadlock. The Banker's Algorithm is the classic algorithm for this.||
36. **Answer:** ||(B) This is the critical distinction. Deadlock is a permanent state of circular waiting. Starvation is when a process is consistently overlooked by the scheduler (e.g., due to low priority), but the system as a whole is still making progress.||
37. **Answer:** ||(C) Requirements Engineering (or Analysis) is the first phase where the stakeholders' needs are gathered, analyzed, and documented to produce a clear specification of what the system must accomplish.||
38. **Answer:** ||(C) This is the fundamental definition. A well-designed system consists of modules that are highly cohesive (their internal parts are all strongly related to a single purpose) and loosely coupled (they have minimal dependencies on other modules).||
39. **Answer:** ||(C) The Waterfall model is a rigid, traditional approach where you complete the entire Requirements phase, then the entire Design phase, then Implementation, and so on. It is not well-suited for projects with changing requirements.||
40. **Answer:** ||(B) High cohesion means a module does one thing well. Low coupling means changes to one module have minimal impact on other modules. This leads to a more maintainable, reusable, and understandable system.||
<br>

    - [ ] A script used to start and stop Docker containers.
    - [ ] A configuration file for a Docker Swarm cluster.
    - [ ] A text file that contains a set of instructions for building a Docker image.
    - [ ] A running instance of a Docker image.
    <br>

45. **What is the difference between "white-box" and "black-box" testing?**
    - [ ] White-box testing is automated, while black-box testing is manual.
    - [ ] White-box testing is performed by the client, while black-box testing is performed by the developer.
    - [ ] White-box testing examines the internal code structure and logic, while black-box testing focuses only on the external functionality without knowledge of the internals.
    - [ ] Black-box testing is more thorough than white-box testing.
    <br>

    - [ ] A way to organize source code into different containers.
    - [ ] A security technique for containing viruses.
    - [ ] A method for deploying applications on bare-metal servers.
    <br>

48. **In DevOps, what is "Infrastructure as Code" (IaC)?**
    - [ ] Writing infrastructure documentation in a code repository.
    - [ ] Managing and provisioning infrastructure (networks, virtual machines, etc.) through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration.
    - [ ] The practice of embedding infrastructure details directly into application code.
    - [ ] A hardware description language.
    <br>

    - [ ] A containerization platform like Docker.
    - [ ] An open-source automation server that is a key tool for building Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.
    - [ ] A project management tool like Jira.
    <br>

**Answer Key (41-50)**
41. **Answer:** ||(D) The Agile Manifesto values working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change over comprehensive documentation, contract negotiation, and rigidly following a plan. It also values individuals and interactions over processes and tools.||
42. **Answer:** ||(C) The Sprint is the core iterative cycle in Scrum. It is a fixed-length event during which a usable and potentially releasable product increment is created.||
43. **Answer:** ||(B) Continuous Integration (CI) is a practice where developers merge their code changes back to a main branch frequently. Each merge triggers an automated build and test sequence to detect integration errors as quickly as possible.||
44. **Answer:** ||(C) A Dockerfile is the blueprint for creating a Docker image. It contains a series of commands that assemble the image layer by layer, including the base OS, dependencies, application code, and runtime commands.||
