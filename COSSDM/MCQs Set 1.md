### **Topic 1: OS Introduction & Linux Basics (Sessions 1-2)**

1.  **What is the primary purpose of a "system call" in an operating system?**
    - [ ] To allow the operating system to call functions within a user application.
    - [ ] To provide an interface for user applications to request services from the operating system kernel.
    - [ ] To handle hardware interrupts from peripheral devices.
    - [ ] To switch the CPU from user mode to kernel mode without a specific request.
    <br>

2.  **The fundamental difference between User Mode and Kernel Mode is:**
    - [ ] Kernel mode allows access to all CPU instructions and hardware, while user mode is restricted.
    - [ ] User mode is faster because it does not have security checks.
    - [ ] Applications run in kernel mode, while the OS runs in user mode.
    - [ ] A switch from user mode to kernel mode is a very low-overhead operation.
    <br>

3.  **In the Linux file system, which command is used to change the ownership of a file from one user to another?**
    - [ ] `chmod`
    - [ ] `chown`
    - [ ] `chgrp`
    - [ ] `usermod`
    <br>

4.  **What does the Linux command `chmod 754 file.txt` do?**
    - [ ] Grants read, write, and execute permissions to the owner; read and execute to the group; read only to others.
    - [ ] Grants read and write to the owner; execute to the group; read and write to others.
    - [ ] Grants read, write, and execute to everyone.
    - [ ] The command is invalid.
    <br>

5.  **A Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) is primarily characterized by:**
    - [ ] Its ability to run on multiple processors.
    - [ ] Its graphical user interface.
    - [ ] Its predictability and ability to meet strict timing deadlines.
    - [ ] Its small memory footprint.
    <br>

6.  **What is the function of the `pipe` (`|`) operator in a Linux shell?**
    - [ ] To redirect the output of a command to a file.
    - [ ] To run two commands simultaneously.
    - [ ] To use the standard output of one command as the standard input for another command.
    - [ ] To terminate a command.
    <br>

7.  **How are command-line arguments passed to a shell script accessed within the script?**
    - [ ] Using `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, etc., where `$0` is the script name itself.
    - [ ] Using `ARGV[1]`, `ARGV[2]`, etc.
    - [ ] Using the `read` command.
    - [ ] They are stored in a special file named `.args`.
    <br>

8.  **An "interrupt" in an operating system is typically generated by:**
    - [ ] The application software to request a service.
    - [ ] The hardware to signal that an event needs immediate attention from the kernel.
    - [ ] The OS to terminate a running process.
    - [ ] The user pressing a key on the keyboard.
    <br>

9.  **Which statement best describes the relationship between the Shell and the Kernel in Linux?**
    - [ ] The Shell is the core of the OS, and the Kernel is a utility program.
    - [ ] They are two names for the same component.
    - [ ] The Kernel is the core of the OS that manages hardware, and the Shell is a command-line interpreter that provides a user interface to the Kernel's services.
    - [ ] The Kernel runs in user space, while the Shell runs in kernel space.
    <br>

10. **What is the effect of the command `ls -l > output.txt`?**
    - [ ] It displays the long listing of files on the screen and appends it to `output.txt`.
    - [ ] It creates a file named `output.txt` containing the text "ls -l".
    - [ ] It redirects the standard output of the `ls -l` command to the file `output.txt`, overwriting the file if it exists.
    - [ ] It displays an error because `>` is not a valid argument for `ls`.
    <br>

**Answer Key (1-10)**
1.  **Answer:** ||(B) System calls are the mechanism through which a user-level program can request protected services from the kernel, such as file I/O, process creation, or network communication.||
2.  **Answer:** ||(A) The hardware provides at least two modes of operation. Kernel mode (or supervisor mode) has privileged access to all system resources. User mode is a restricted mode where applications run, preventing them from interfering with the OS or other processes.||
3.  **Answer:** ||(B) `chown` stands for "change owner" and is used to change the user and/or group ownership of a given file or directory.||
4.  **Answer:** ||(A) The octal permissions translate as follows: `7` (owner) is `rwx` (4+2+1). `5` (group) is `r-x` (4+0+1). `4` (others) is `r--` (4+0+0).||
5.  **Answer:** ||(C) The defining characteristic of an RTOS is not speed, but determinism. It must be able to guarantee that a task will be completed within a specific, predictable time constraint.||
6.  **Answer:** ||(C) The pipe is a powerful mechanism for chaining commands together. It connects the STDOUT of the command on its left to the STDIN of the command on its right.||
7.  **Answer:** ||(A) `$0` represents the name of the script itself. Positional parameters passed to the script are accessed via `$1` for the first, `$2` for the second, and so on. `$#` gives the count of arguments.||
8.  **Answer:** ||(B) An interrupt is a signal from a hardware device (like a disk controller or network card) to the CPU, indicating that an event (like I/O completion) has occurred and requires kernel intervention.||
9.  **Answer:** ||(C) This describes the fundamental user-OS interaction in a command-line environment. The Shell is a user-level application that interprets commands and uses system calls to ask the Kernel to perform actions.||
10. **Answer:** ||(C) The `>` operator is the standard output redirection operator. It takes the output that would normally go to the screen and writes it to a specified file, creating the file if it doesn't exist or overwriting it if it does. `>>` is used for appending.||
<br>

### **Topic 2: Shell Programming & Processes (Sessions 3-5)**

11. **In a shell script, what is the purpose of the `test` command or the `[...]` construct?**
    - [ ] To execute a command in a test environment.
    - [ ] To evaluate a conditional expression, typically used within an `if` or `while` statement.
    - [ ] To create a temporary file for testing.
    - [ ] To check the script for syntax errors.
    <br>

12. **What is the difference between a process and a thread?**
    - [ ] A process is a program on disk, while a thread is a program in memory.
    - [ ] A process has its own dedicated memory space, while threads within the same process share memory space.
    - [ ] Processes are managed by the Shell, while threads are managed by the Kernel.
    - [ ] A process can have only one thread.
    <br>

13. **Which process scheduling algorithm can lead to "starvation" for low-priority processes?**
    - [ ] First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
    - [ ] Round Robin (RR)
    - [ ] Strict Priority-Based Scheduling
    - [ ] Shortest Job First (SJF)
    <br>

14. **What is a "zombie" process in a Unix-like system?**
    - [ ] A process that is consuming 100% of the CPU.
    - [ ] A process that has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table because its parent has not yet read its exit status.
    - [ ] A malicious process that cannot be killed.
    - [ ] A process running in the background.
    <br>

15. **The `fork()` system call in a Unix-like OS is used to:**
    - [ ] Execute a new program.
    - [ ] Terminate a process.
    - [ ] Create a new child process which is a near-identical copy of the parent process.
    - [ ] Wait for a child process to terminate.
    <br>

16. **Which process scheduler is responsible for selecting a process from the job queue and loading it into memory for execution?**
    - [ ] Short-term scheduler (CPU scheduler)
    - [ ] Medium-term scheduler
    - [ ] Long-term scheduler (Job scheduler)
    - [ ] I/O scheduler
    <br>

17. **In Round Robin (RR) scheduling, what happens if the time quantum is made very large?**
    - [ ] The algorithm becomes more efficient.
    - [ ] The algorithm behaves like First-Come, First-Served (FCFS).
    - [ ] The algorithm behaves like Shortest Job First (SJF).
    - [ ] It leads to starvation.
    <br>

18. **An "orphan" process is a process whose:**
    - [ ] Parent process has terminated before the child.
    - [ ] Execution has completed, but it remains in the process table.
    - [ ] Memory has been swapped out to disk.
    - [ ] `fork()` call failed.
    <br>

19. **What is preemption in the context of process scheduling?**
    - [ ] The ability of the operating system to forcibly interrupt a running process and switch the CPU to another process.
    - [ ] The process of predicting the next CPU burst of a process.
    - [ ] The act of a process voluntarily giving up the CPU.
    - [ ] A process that completes its execution before its time slice expires.
    <br>

20. **Belady's Anomaly states that:**
    - [ ] The shortest jobs should always be scheduled first for optimal turnaround time.
    - [ ] Increasing the number of page frames can, in some rare cases, increase the number of page faults for certain page replacement algorithms (like FIFO).
    - [ ] A parent process must always wait for its child process to complete.
    - [ ] The average waiting time is always minimized by the FCFS algorithm.
    <br>

**Answer Key (11-20)**
11. **Answer:** ||(B) The `test` command (and its synonym `[ ... ]`) is a shell built-in used to check file attributes and perform string and numeric comparisons. Its exit status (0 for true, non-zero for false) is used by control flow statements like `if`.||
12. **Answer:** ||(B) This is the fundamental difference. Processes are isolated from each other by the OS. Threads provide a mechanism for concurrency within a single process and share resources like memory, which makes communication easier but requires synchronization.||
13. **Answer:** ||(C) In a strict, preemptive priority-based system, if there is a continuous stream of high-priority tasks, a low-priority task might never get a chance to run, leading to starvation.||
14. **Answer:** ||(B) A zombie process is technically dead but hasn't been "reaped" by its parent (via the `wait()` system call). It consumes a process ID but no other significant resources.||
15. **Answer:** ||(C) The `fork()` call creates a new process by duplicating the calling process. The new process, the child, is an exact copy of the parent at that moment, including memory and open files. The `exec()` family of calls is used to replace the current process's memory space with a new program.||
16. **Answer:** ||(C) The Long-term scheduler controls the degree of multiprogramming by deciding which processes from the larger job pool are admitted into the ready queue in main memory.||
17. **Answer:** ||(B) The time quantum in RR determines the maximum time slice a process gets before being preempted. If the quantum is larger than the longest CPU burst of any process, no process will ever be preempted mid-burst, and they will run to completion in the order they arrived, just like FCFS.||
18. **Answer:** ||(A) When a parent process terminates, any of its running child processes become orphans. They are then typically adopted by the `init` process (process ID 1), which will wait for them to prevent them from becoming zombies.||
19. **Answer:** ||(A) Preemptive scheduling allows the OS to maintain control and ensure fairness or responsiveness by interrupting processes (e.g., when their time slice expires) and reallocating the CPU. Non-preemptive scheduling means a process runs until it voluntarily blocks or terminates.||
20. **Answer:** ||(B) Belady's Anomaly is a counter-intuitive result specific to page replacement algorithms. It demonstrates that simply adding more physical memory (page frames) does not always guarantee better performance (fewer page faults) for certain naive algorithms like FIFO.||
<br>

### **Topic 3: Memory Management & Deadlock (Sessions 6-9)**

21. **What is "internal fragmentation"?**
    - [ ] The loss of memory due to the space between allocated partitions.
    - [ ] The unused memory that is internal to a process's allocated memory partition.
    - [ ] The fragmentation that occurs on the hard disk.
    - [ ] The time lost when compacting memory.
    <br>

22. **In a paged memory management system, a "page fault" occurs when:**
    - [ ] The requested page is already in physical memory.
    - [ ] The CPU generates a memory address that is not in the process's logical address space.
    - [ ] The requested page is not currently in physical memory and must be loaded from disk.
    - [ ] The page table itself is corrupted.
    <br>

23. **The "Best Fit" memory allocation algorithm works by:**
    - [ ] Allocating the first hole that is big enough.
    - [ ] Allocating the largest available hole.
    - [ ] Allocating the smallest hole that is big enough.
    - [ ] Allocating memory from the end of the heap.
    <br>

24. **What is the primary purpose of a Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)?**
    - [ ] To store recently used disk blocks.
    - [ ] To act as a cache for the page table to speed up the translation of logical to physical addresses.
    - [ ] To buffer I/O operations.
    - [ ] To store the state of running processes.
    <br>

25. **Which of the following is NOT one of the four necessary conditions for a deadlock to occur?**
    - [ ] Mutual Exclusion
    - [ ] Hold and Wait
    - [ ] Preemption
    - [ ] Circular Wait
    <br>

26. **What is a "semaphore"?**
    - [ ] A hardware lock on the CPU.
    - [ ] A synchronization primitive that is essentially an integer counter, used to control access to a resource with a limited number of instances.
    - [ ] A type of process scheduler.
    - [ ] A mechanism for virtual memory.
    <br>

27. **The difference between a "mutex" and a "binary semaphore" is that:**
    - [ ] A mutex is faster.
    - [ ] A semaphore can be used across different processes.
    - [ ] A mutex can only be released by the same thread that acquired it (it has the concept of ownership).
    - [ ] A mutex can count higher than 1.
    <br>

28. **In "demand paging", a page is loaded into main memory:**
    - [ ] When the program first starts.
    - [ ] When the page is first referenced by the CPU.
    - [ ] Periodically, based on a timer.
    - [ ] When the programmer explicitly calls a `load_page()` function.
    <br>

29. **Which deadlock handling strategy involves preventing one of the four necessary conditions from ever occurring?**
    - [ ] Deadlock Detection and Recovery
    - [ ] Deadlock Prevention
    - [ ] Deadlock Avoidance
    - [ ] Ignoring the problem
    <br>

30. **What is "compaction" in the context of memory management?**
    - [ ] Compressing data before writing it to disk.
    - [ ] The process of shuffling memory contents to place all free memory together into one large block.
    - [ ] Reducing the size of a page table.
    - [ ] A type of process scheduling algorithm.
    <br>

**Answer Key (21-30)**
21. **Answer:** ||(B) Internal fragmentation occurs when a memory block allocated to a process is larger than what the process requested. The unused space within that allocated block is the internal fragment. This is common in fixed-size partitioning and paging.||
22. **Answer:** ||(C) A page fault is a type of interrupt, raised by the memory management unit (MMU), that tells the OS it needs to handle a memory access to a page that is not currently mapped into a physical frame. The OS must then load the page from secondary storage.||
23. **Answer:** ||(C) The Best Fit algorithm searches the entire list of free holes to find the smallest one that can satisfy the request. This aims to minimize the size of the leftover hole (internal fragmentation).||
24. **Answer:** ||(B) Accessing the page table in memory for every memory reference would be slow. The TLB is a small, fast hardware cache that stores recent logical-to-physical address translations to speed up this process.||
25. **Answer:** ||(C) The four necessary conditions are Mutual Exclusion, Hold and Wait, **No Preemption**, and Circular Wait. Preemption is the ability to take a resource away, and having it can help prevent deadlocks.||
26. **Answer:** ||(B) A semaphore maintains a count. A thread calls `wait()` (or `P()`) to decrement the count (and potentially block if it's zero), and `signal()` (or `V()`) to increment it (and potentially wake a waiting thread). This can be used to manage access to a pool of `N` resources.||
27. **Answer:** ||(C) This concept of ownership is the key difference. A mutex is like a key to a room; the person who locked it must be the one to unlock it. A semaphore is more like a count of available passes; any thread can return a pass (`signal`) even if it wasn't the one that took it (`wait`).||
28. **Answer:** ||(B) Demand paging is a lazy loading technique. It avoids loading pages into memory until they are actually needed, which is signaled by a page fault when the CPU tries to access an address within that page.||
29. **Answer:** ||(B) Deadlock prevention strategies aim to break one of the four necessary conditions. For example, enforcing a strict order for acquiring resources breaks the Circular Wait condition.||
30. **Answer:** ||(B) Compaction is the solution to external fragmentation. It is a time-consuming process that moves allocated memory blocks to one end of memory to consolidate all the small, scattered free holes into a single, large, usable block.||

    <br>

35. **In object-oriented design, "Cohesion" refers to:**
    - [ ] The degree to which elements inside a module belong together.
    - [ ] The degree to which different modules depend on each other.
    - [ ] The process of breaking a large system into smaller modules.
    - [ ] The reusability of a module.
    <br>

36. **What is the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`?**
    - [ ] `git pull` downloads changes from a remote repository, while `git fetch` uploads changes.
    - [ ] `git fetch` downloads new data from a remote repository but does not integrate it into your working branch. `git pull` does both a fetch and a merge.
    - [ ] `git pull` is for branches, `git fetch` is for tags.
    - [ ] There is no difference.
    <br>

    - [ ] Waterfall Model
    - [ ] Agile Model
    - [ ] Spiral Model
    - [ ] V-Model
    <br>

38. **In object-oriented design, "Coupling" refers to:**
    - [ ] The degree to which elements inside a module belong together.
    - [ ] The measure of dependency between two or more modules.
    - [ ] The process of grouping related classes together.
    - [ ] The relationship between a class and its parent.
    <br>

39. **What does the `git merge` command do?**
    - [ ] It deletes a branch.
    - [ ] It lists all the branches in the repository.
    - [ ] It joins two or more development histories (branches) together.
    - [ ] It creates a new local repository.
    <br>

40. **A good software design should aim for:**
    - [ ] High cohesion and high coupling.
    - [ ] Low cohesion and low coupling.
    - [ ] High cohesion and low coupling.
    - [ ] Low cohesion and high coupling.
    <br>

**Answer Key (31-40)**
31. **Answer:** ||(C) The Waterfall Model is a classic, rigid SDLC where development flows sequentially through phases like Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, and Maintenance.||
32. **Answer:** ||(B) A Version Control System (VCS) like Git creates a history of snapshots of your project. This allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase, merge their changes, and revert to previous versions if needed.||
33. **Answer:** ||(D) The Agile Manifesto outlines four core values, prioritizing working software, customer collaboration, individual interactions, and responding to change over rigid processes and documentation.||
34. **Answer:** ||(D) `git commit` takes the files that have been staged (using `git add`) and creates a new permanent snapshot of them in the local repository's history, identified by a unique hash and associated with the provided message.||
35. **Answer:** ||(A) High cohesion is a desirable quality. It means that all the methods and properties within a single class are highly related and focused on a single, well-defined purpose.||
36. **Answer:** ||(B) `git fetch` is a safe way to review changes from the remote repository without immediately merging them into your current work. `git pull` is a shortcut for `git fetch` followed immediately by `git merge`.||
37. **Answer:** ||(C) The Spiral Model is an iterative model specifically designed for risk management. Each loop of the spiral involves planning, risk analysis, engineering (prototyping), and evaluation, making it suitable for large, complex, and high-risk projects.||
38. **Answer:** ||(B) Low coupling is a desirable quality. It means that modules are independent and a change in one module is less likely to require changes in other modules.||
39. **Answer:** ||(C) Merging is a fundamental Git operation that takes the independent lines of development created by `git branch` and integrates them back into a single branch.||
40. **Answer:** ||(C) A well-designed system consists of modules that are highly focused on a single task (High Cohesion) and are independent of other modules (Low Coupling).||

    - [ ] An image is a running instance, while a container is a template.
    - [ ] An image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run an application. A container is a running instance of an image.
    - [ ] An image is stored on the Docker Hub, while a container runs locally.
    - [ ] They are the same thing.
    <br>

45. **Which testing method involves testing the internal structure and logic of the code?**
    - [ ] Black-box testing

    - [ ] Verification is checking if the software conforms to its specification ("Are we building the product right?"). Validation is checking if the software meets the user's actual needs ("Are we building the right product?").
    - [ ] Verification is automated testing, while validation is manual testing.
    - [ ] There is no difference.
    <br>

49. **Jenkins is a popular open-source tool used for:**

    <br>

**Answer Key (41-50)**
41. **Answer:** ||(A) The Sprint is the core iterative cycle in the Scrum agile framework. It is a consistent, fixed-length period where the team works to deliver a potentially shippable increment of the product.||
42. **Answer:** ||(B) Continuous Integration aims to prevent the problems that arise when developers work in isolation for long periods. By merging and testing frequently, integration issues are caught early and fixed more easily.||
43. **Answer:** ||(B) A Dockerfile is a recipe for creating a Docker image. It specifies a base image and then a series of commands to install software, copy files, and configure the environment needed to run an application.||
44. **Answer:** ||(B) This is the fundamental concept. An image is the blueprint (like a class in OOP). A container is a live, running instance of that blueprint (like an object). You can run many containers from a single image.||
45. **Answer:** ||(C) White-box testing requires knowledge of the internal workings of the code. Testers use this knowledge to design test cases that exercise specific code paths, branches, and statements. Black-box testing only considers the external behavior (inputs and outputs).||
46. **Answer:** ||(C) Kubernetes is a container orchestrator. It automates the complex tasks of deploying containers across a cluster of machines, handling scaling, networking, and ensuring services remain available (self-healing).||
47. **Answer:** ||(B) Selenium is a suite of tools for browser automation. It allows testers to write scripts that programmatically interact with a web application's UI (clicking buttons, filling forms) to verify its functionality.||
