### **Quantitative Aptitude | Chapter 5: Ratio, Proportion and Partnership**

Welcome to Chapter 5. This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of comparing quantities. A **Ratio** is used to compare two or more quantities of the same kind. A **Proportion** is an equality of two ratios. **Partnership** is a practical business application of these concepts, used to distribute profits or losses among partners. Understanding how to manipulate ratios is a core skill that simplifies many complex problems.

#### **1. Ratio**

A ratio is a way to compare two quantities by division. The ratio of a quantity `a` to a quantity `b` is written as `a:b` and is read as "a is to b". It is equivalent to the fraction `a/b`.

*   `a` is called the **antecedent**.
*   `b` is called the **consequent**.

**Key Properties:**
*   A ratio remains unchanged if both parts are multiplied or divided by the same non-zero number. `a:b` is the same as `(a*k) : (b*k)`.
*   This is why ratios are always expressed in their **simplest form** (by dividing both parts by their HCF). For example, the ratio `16:24` is simplified to `2:3`.

**Combining Ratios:** This is a very common task. If you know `A:B` and `B:C`, you can find `A:B:C`.

**Example: If A:B = 3:4 and B:C = 8:9, find A:B:C.**
1.  **Identify the common term:** The common term is `B`.
2.  **Make the common term equal:** In `A:B`, B is 4. In `B:C`, B is 8. The LCM of 4 and 8 is 8.
3.  **Adjust the ratios:**
    *   To make B=8 in the first ratio, multiply by 2: `A:B = (3 * 2) : (4 * 2) = 6:8`.
    *   The second ratio already has B=8, so it remains `B:C = 8:9`.
4.  **Combine:** Now that B is the same in both, you can combine them: `A:B:C = 6:8:9`.

**Shortcut (Zigzag/N method):**
For `A:B = a:b` and `B:C = c:d`, then `A:B:C = (a*c) : (b*c) : (b*d)`.

`A : B`   `3 : 4`
`B : C`       `8 : 9`
`A:B:C = (3*8) : (4*8) : (4*9) = 24 : 32 : 36`.
Now, simplify by dividing all by their HCF (4): `6 : 8 : 9`.

> **Quick Question:** If the ratio of boys to girls in a class is 2:3 and there are 24 boys, how many girls are there?
> **Answer:** The ratio part for boys is 2, which corresponds to 24 students. So, 1 part = 24/2 = 12 students. The ratio part for girls is 3. So, number of girls = 3 * 12 = 36.

#### **2. Proportion**

A proportion is a statement that two ratios are equal. If `a:b` is equal to `c:d`, we write it as `a:b :: c:d`.

**The Golden Rule of Proportion:**
`Product of Extremes = Product of Means`
In `a:b :: c:d`, `a` and `d` are the extremes (outer terms), and `b` and `c` are the means (inner terms).
Therefore, `a * d = b * c`.

This rule is used to find a missing term.

*   **Fourth Proportional:** In `a:b :: c:x`, `x` is the fourth proportional. `x = (b*c)/a`.
*   **Third Proportional:** In `a:b :: b:x`, `x` is the third proportional. `x = b²/a`.
*   **Mean Proportional:** The mean proportional between `a` and `b` is `x` in `a:x :: x:b`. `x² = ab`, so `x = sqrt(ab)`.

> **Quick Question:** What is the fourth proportional to 3, 5, and 21?
> **Answer:** We have `3:5 :: 21:x`. So `3*x = 5*21`. `x = (5*21)/3 = 5*7 = 35`.

#### **3. Partnership**

This is a business application of ratios. Profits or losses in a business are shared among partners in the ratio of their "effective investments".

**Effective Investment = Capital Invested × Time Period of Investment**

##### **a) Simple Partnership**
When all partners invest their capital for the **same period of time**. In this case, the time component is equal for all, so it cancels out.
`Profit Ratio = Ratio of Capitals Invested`

**Example:** A and B start a business with investments of ₹20,000 and ₹30,000 respectively. If they make a profit of ₹2400 after one year, what is A's share?
1.  Investment ratio `A:B = 20000 : 30000 = 2:3`.
2.  Since the time is the same (1 year), the profit ratio is also `2:3`.
3.  Total ratio parts = `2 + 3 = 5`.
4.  5 parts correspond to ₹2400. So, 1 part = `2400 / 5 = ₹480`.
5.  A's share is 2 parts: `2 * 480 = ₹960`.

##### **b) Compound Partnership**
When partners invest their capital for **different periods of time**.
`Profit Ratio = Ratio of (Capital × Time)`

**Example:** A invests ₹10,000 for 12 months. B joins after 4 months (so invests for 8 months) with ₹12,000. Find the ratio in which they share the profit.
1.  `Profit_A : Profit_B = (Investment_A * Time_A) : (Investment_B * Time_B)`
2.  `= (10000 * 12) : (12000 * 8)`
3.  `= 120000 : 96000`
4.  Simplify the ratio by dividing by 24000: `5 : 4`.

### **Topic Summary & Revision**

*   **Ratio:** A comparison `a:b`. Simplify by dividing by HCF.
*   **Combining Ratios:** Make the common term equal. `A:B=a:b`, `B:C=c:d` -> `A:B:C = ac:bc:bd`.
*   **Proportion:** `a:b :: c:d` means `a/b = c/d`. The key rule is `a*d = b*c`.
*   **Partnership:** The distribution of profit is the core concept.
    *   **Simple Partnership (Same Time):** Profit ratio = Investment ratio.
    *   **Compound Partnership (Different Times):** Profit ratio = `(Inv1 * Time1) : (Inv2 * Time2)`.

    <br>

**Answer Key**
1.  **B**: ||A:B = 5:7 and B:C = 6:11. Make B common (LCM of 7, 6 is 42). A:B = (5\*6):(7\*6) = 30:42. B:C = (6\*7):(11\*7) = 42:77. So, A:B:C = 30:42:77.||
<br>
2.  **B**: ||Let the numbers be 3x and 5x. According to the question, (3x - 9) / (5x - 9) = 12/23. Cross-multiply: 23(3x-9) = 12(5x-9) => 69x - 207 = 60x - 108 => 9x = 99 => x=11. The smaller number is 3x = 3 \* 11 = 33.||
<br>
3.  **B**: ||Mean proportional between a and b is sqrt(a\*b). So, sqrt(9\*64) = 3 \* 8 = 24.||
<br>
4.  **C**: ||Let the number of coins be 5x, 9x, and 4x. Convert their values to rupees. Value = (5x \* 0.50) + (9x \* 0.25) + (4x \* 0.10) = 2.5x + 2.25x + 0.4x = 5.15x. Given 5.15x = 206 => x = 206 / 5.15 = 40. Number of 50p coins = 5x = 5 \* 40 = 200.||
<br>
5.  **B**: ||This is a simple partnership. Profit ratio = Investment ratio. Ratio = 20000:25000:30000 = 20:25:30 = 4:5:6. Total parts = 4+5+6 = 15. B's share = (5/15) \* 15000 = (1/3) \* 15000 = ₹5,000.||
<br>
6.  **C**: ||Let initial salaries be 2k, 3k, 5k. New salaries: A's = 2k \* 1.15 = 2.3k. B's = 3k \* 1.10 = 3.3k. C's = 5k \* 1.20 = 6.0k. New ratio = 2.3k : 3.3k : 6.0k. Multiply by 10 to remove decimals: 23:33:60.||
<br>
7.  **B**: ||Let the quantities be 5x (milk) and 1x (water). After adding 5L of water, the new quantity of water is (x+5). The milk is unchanged. New ratio: 5x / (x+5) = 5/2. Cross-multiply: 10x = 5(x+5) => 10x = 5x + 25 => 5x = 25. The original quantity of milk was 5x, so it is 25 litres.||
<br>
8.  **D**: ||This is a compound partnership. A invests for 12 months. B invests for 12-5=7 months. Let B's capital be C. Profit ratio = (A's inv \* A's time) : (B's inv \* B's time) = 2:3. So, (3500 \* 12) / (C \* 7) = 2/3. 42000 / (7C) = 2/3. 6000 / C = 2/3. 18000 = 2C. C = ₹9000.||
<br>
9.  **C**: ||Let the numbers be N1 and N2. Given: 40% of N1 = (2/3) of N2. So, (40/100) \* N1 = (2/3) \* N2 => (2/5) \* N1 = (2/3) \* N2. The 2s cancel. (1/5)N1 = (1/3)N2. We want the ratio N1/N2. N1/N2 = 5/3. So the ratio is 5:3.||
<br>
10. **A**: ||Let A's investment be x. A invests for 12 months. B invests 2x for 6 months. C invests 3x for 4 months (12-8). Profit ratio = (x\*12) : (2x\*6) : (3x\*4) = 12x : 12x : 12x = 1:1:1. The profit is shared equally. C's share = (1/3) \* 27000 = ₹9,000.||

### **Bonus Tips**

*   **Assumption is Key:** In ratio problems, you can often assume the numbers are the ratios themselves to find a percentage or a new ratio (like in Q6). If the initial ratio is 2:3:5, assume the salaries are 200, 300, and 500 to make percentage calculations easy.
*   **Units Must Match:** When creating a ratio, ensure all quantities are in the same unit (e.g., all in months, all in rupees, all in kg). A common trap is to mix units.
*   **Partnership Shortcut:** Remember the single formula `Profit Ratio = (C1*T1) : (C2*T2) : ...`. This one formula solves almost every partnership problem. Just be careful to calculate the `Time` component for each partner correctly.
