## **Quantitative Aptitude | Chapter 9: Speed, Distance and Time**

Welcome to Chapter 9. This is a core topic in quantitative aptitude that models the relationship between speed, distance, and time. The problems often involve scenarios like moving trains, boats in streams, and races. While the base formula is simple, the questions can be tricky. The key is to maintain consistent units and to understand the concept of relative speed.

---

### **1. The Core Formula**

Everything in this chapter boils down to one fundamental relationship:

`Distance = Speed × Time`

From this, you can derive the other two:
*   `Speed = Distance / Time`
*   `Time = Distance / Speed`

**The Golden Rule: Unit Consistency**
This is the most common place where errors occur. Before you apply any formula, ensure all units are consistent.
*   If Speed is in **km/hr**, then Distance must be in **km** and Time must be in **hours**.
*   If Speed is in **m/s**, then Distance must be in **meters** and Time must be in **seconds**.

**Essential Conversions:**
*   To convert from **km/hr to m/s**: Multiply by **5/18**.
    *   *Why?* 1 km = 1000 m, 1 hr = 3600 s. So 1 km/hr = 1000/3600 m/s = 5/18 m/s.
*   To convert from **m/s to km/hr**: Multiply by **18/5**.

> **Quick Question:** A car travels at 72 km/hr. How many meters will it cover in 10 seconds?
> **Answer:** First, convert speed to m/s. Speed = `72 \* (5/18) = 4 \* 5 = 20 m/s`.
> Distance = `Speed \* Time = 20 m/s \* 10 s = 200 meters`.

### **2. Average Speed**

This is a frequently misunderstood concept. Average speed is **NOT** the average of the two speeds.

**Formula:** `Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time`

**Case 1: Equal Distances**
If a person travels a certain distance at a speed `x` and the *same distance* back at a speed `y`, the average speed for the entire journey is the **Harmonic Mean** of the speeds.
`Average Speed = (2xy) / (x + y)`

**Example: A man goes from home to office at 30 km/hr and returns at 20 km/hr. Find his average speed.**
*   **Wrong Method:** (30+20)/2 = 25 km/hr.
*   **Correct Method:** `(2 \* 30 \* 20) / (30 + 20) = 1200 / 50 = 24 km/hr`.

---

### **3. Relative Speed**

When two objects are moving, their speed relative to each other is what determines when they will meet or overtake.

*   **Objects moving in the Same Direction:** Their relative speed is the **difference** of their speeds.
    *   `Relative Speed = |S1 - S2|`
*   **Objects moving in Opposite Directions:** Their relative speed is the **sum** of their speeds.
    *   `Relative Speed = S1 + S2`

This concept is the key to solving all problems involving trains, thieves, etc. The formula `Time = Distance / Speed` becomes `Time_to_meet = Total_Distance_to_cover / Relative_Speed`.

---

### **4. Problems Involving Trains**

*   **A train crossing a pole/man/point object:** The distance the train needs to cover is its own length.
    *   `Time = (Length of Train) / (Speed of Train)`
*   **A train crossing a bridge/platform/tunnel (an object with length):** The distance the train needs to cover is the sum of its own length and the length of the object.
    *   `Time = (Length of Train + Length of Platform) / (Speed of Train)`
*   **Two trains crossing each other:** The total distance to be covered is the **sum of the lengths of both trains**. The speed to be used is their **relative speed**.
    *   `Time = (L1 + L2) / (Relative Speed)`

---

### **Topic Summary & Revision**

*   **Base Formula:** `Distance = Speed × Time`.
*   **Unit Conversion:** Master km/hr to m/s (`\* 5/18`) and vice-versa (`\* 18/5`).
*   **Average Speed:** It's `Total Distance / Total Time`. For two equal distances, use the harmonic mean `2xy / (x+y)`.
*   **Relative Speed:** This is the most important concept.
    *   Same Direction -> Subtract speeds (`S1 - S2`).
    *   Opposite Direction -> Add speeds (`S1 + S2`).
*   **Train Problems:** The "distance" is almost always the sum of the lengths of the objects involved (trains, platforms). The "speed" is almost always the relative speed.

**Answer Key**
1.  **C**: ||Speed = 690 km / 30 hr = 23 km/hr. To convert to m/s, Speed = 23 \* (5/18) ≈ 6.38 m/s.||
2.  **B**: ||Distance to cover = Length of Train = 100 m. Speed = 30 km/hr = 30 \* (5/18) = 25/3 m/s. Time = Distance / Speed = 100 / (25/3) = 100 \* 3 / 25 = 4 \* 3 = 12 seconds.||
3.  **B**: ||The distances are equal (160 km). Use the harmonic mean formula for average speed: (2 \* 64 \* 80) / (64 + 80) = (2 \* 64 \* 80) / 144 = 10240 / 144 ≈ 71.11 km/hr.||
4.  **A**: ||Total distance covered = L + L = 2L. They are moving in the same direction, so Relative Speed = 46 - 36 = 10 km/hr. Convert to m/s: 10 \* (5/18) = 25/9 m/s. Time = Distance / Speed => 36 = 2L / (25/9). 36 = 18L / 25. L = (36 \* 25) / 18 = 2 \* 25 = 50 m.||
5.  **B**: ||The bus loses time due to stoppages. Time lost per hour = (Difference in speed) / (Faster speed) = (54 - 45) / 54 = 9/54 = 1/6 hour. In minutes, this is (1/6) \* 60 = 10 minutes.||
6.  **B**: ||First, convert speed: 54 km/hr = 54 \* (5/18) = 15 m/s. When passing the man, Distance = Length of Train (L). L = Speed \* Time = 15 \* 20 = 300 m. When passing the platform, Distance = L + Length of Platform (P). L+P = Speed \* Time = 15 \* 36 = 540 m. So, 300 + P = 540 => P = 240 m.||
7.  **C**: ||When they meet, they will have been travelling for the same amount of time (T). The difference in distance covered is due to the difference in their speeds. Difference in speed = 60 - 50 = 10 km/hr. Time to create a 120 km gap = Distance Gap / Speed Difference = 120 / 10 = 12 hours. The total distance is the sum of distances covered by both trains in this time. Total distance = Relative Speed \* Time = (50 + 60) \* 12 = 110 \* 12 = 1320 km.||
8.  **B**: ||The policeman needs to cover the initial 100m gap. Relative speed (same direction) = 10 - 8 = 2 km/hr. Convert to m/s: 2 \* (5/18) = 5/9 m/s. Time to catch = Relative Distance / Relative Speed = 100 / (5/9) = 100 \* 9 / 5 = 180 seconds. In this time, the distance run by the thief = Thief's Speed \* Time = (8 \* 5/18) m/s \* 180 s = (20/9) \* 180 = 20 \* 20 = 400 m.||
9.  **A**: ||This question is ambiguous. Assuming the "whole journey" refers only to the first two legs (A->B and B->A), the average speed is the harmonic mean: (2 \* 20 \* 30) / (20 + 30) = 1200 / 50 = 24 km/hr. This is closest to option A. If all three legs are considered, the average speed is 27.69 km/hr, which is closest to B. Given the ambiguity, 24 km/hr is a more standard interpretation.||
10. **A**: ||Distance is constant. Speed is inversely proportional to time. Ratio of speeds = 40:60 = 2:3. Therefore, the ratio of times taken will be the inverse, 3:2. The initial time (3 parts) is 9 hours, so 1 part = 3 hours. The new time (2 parts) will be 2 \* 3 = 6 hours.||

### **Bonus Tips**

*   **Proportionality Trick:** Time is inversely proportional to Speed (`T ∝ 1/S`) when distance is constant. In Q10, the speed ratio is 40:60 or 2:3. Therefore, the time ratio will be the inverse, 3:2. If the initial time (3 parts) is 9 hours, then 1 part = 3 hours. The new time (2 parts) will be `2 \* 3 = 6` hours. This is much faster than calculating the distance.
*   **Stoppage Problem Shortcut:** The formula for stoppage time per hour is: `( (Fast Speed - Slow Speed) / Fast Speed ) \* 60` minutes. For Q5: `((54-45)/54) \* 60 = (9/54) \* 60 = (1/6) \* 60 = 10` minutes.
*   **Assume a Distance:** For average speed problems where the distance is not given (like Q3 and Q9), assume a convenient distance that is the LCM of all the speeds involved. This eliminates fractions and makes calculations much cleaner. For speeds 20, 30, and 40, the LCM is 120.
*   **Relative Speed is Key:** For any problem with two or more moving objects, immediately ask yourself: "Are they moving in the same or opposite directions?" and calculate the relative speed. This is the speed you will use in your `D=S\*T` calculation.
