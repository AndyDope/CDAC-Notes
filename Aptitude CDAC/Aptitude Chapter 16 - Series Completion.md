### **Logical Reasoning | Chapter 16: Series Completion**

Welcome to the Logical Reasoning section. Our first topic is **Series Completion**. These problems test your ability to recognize the underlying pattern or logical rule governing a sequence of numbers, letters, or figures. The key to solving these questions is to quickly test for common patterns like arithmetic progressions, geometric progressions, squares, cubes, and alternating series.

#### **1. Number Series**

This is the most common type of series problem. Your first step should always be to find the **difference** between consecutive terms. Often, the pattern lies in these differences.

**Common Patterns to Look For:**

##### **a) Arithmetic Progression (AP) / Common Difference**
The difference between each consecutive term is constant.
*   **Example:** 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, ?
    *   *Pattern:* The difference is always +3.
    *   *Next Term:* 14 + 3 = 17.

##### **b) Geometric Progression (GP) / Common Ratio**
Each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant number.
*   **Example:** 3, 9, 27, 81, ?
    *   *Pattern:* Each term is multiplied by 3.
    *   *Next Term:* 81 × 3 = 243.

##### **c) Series of Squares or Cubes**
The terms are squares or cubes of consecutive numbers, sometimes with a small addition or subtraction.
*   **Example:** 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ?
    *   *Pattern:* The series consists of squares: 1², 2², 3², 4², 5².
    *   *Next Term:* 6² = 36.
*   **Example:** 0, 7, 26, 63, ?
    *   *Pattern:* This looks complex. Let's check for proximity to cubes: 1³-1, 2³-1, 3³-1, 4³-1.
    *   *Next Term:* 5³ - 1 = 125 - 1 = 124.

##### **d) Alternating Series**
Two or more independent series are interleaved. Look at every alternate term.
*   **Example:** 10, 20, 12, 17, 14, 14, ?
    *   *Series 1 (odd positions):* 10, 12, 14, ... (Pattern is +2). The next term is 16.
    *   *Series 2 (even positions):* 20, 17, 14, ... (Pattern is -3).
    *   *The question asks for the 7th term, which is part of Series 1.*
    *   *Next Term:* 14 + 2 = 16.

##### **e) Two-Stage / Difference of Differences**
The differences between the terms themselves form an AP or GP.
*   **Example:** 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, ?
    *   *1st Differences:* 4, 6, 8, 10, ...
    *   *Pattern:* The differences are increasing by 2. The next difference will be 12.
    *   *Next Term:* 30 + 12 = 42.

> **Quick Question:** Find the next term in the series: 5, 6, 9, 14, 21, ?
> **Answer:** The differences are +1, +3, +5, +7. The next difference will be +9. The next term is 21 + 9 = 30.

#### **2. Alphabet / Letter Series**

These problems work just like number series, but you use the positions of the letters in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26). It is highly recommended to memorize these positions or be able to write them down quickly during an exam.

**Common Patterns:**
*   **Simple Difference:** Skipping letters.
    *   **Example:** C, F, I, L, O, ?
    *   *Positions:* 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, ... (Pattern is +3).
    *   *Next Position:* 18, which is the letter **R**.
*   **Grouped Letters:** Look for patterns within groups of letters.
    *   **Example:** CX, FU, IR, ?, OL
    *   *First Letters:* C, F, I, _, O -> 3, 6, 9, _, 15. The missing letter is L (12).
    *   *Second Letters:* X, U, R, _, L -> 24, 21, 18, _, 12. The missing letter is O (15).
    *   *Next Term:* **LO**.

### **Topic Summary & Revision**

*   **First Step:** Always find the difference (or ratio) between consecutive terms. This will reveal the majority of patterns.
*   **Common Number Patterns:**
    1.  Arithmetic Progression (common difference).
    2.  Geometric Progression (common ratio).
    3.  Squares/Cubes (or `n²±k`, `n³±k`).
    4.  Difference of Differences (two-stage).
    5.  Alternating Series (two independent series mixed together).
*   **Letter Series:** Convert letters to their numerical positions in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, ...). The problem then becomes a number series problem.
*   **Practice:** The more series you see, the faster you will become at recognizing the underlying patterns.

**Answer Key**
1.  **A**: ||The pattern is × 2 + 1. 3\*2+1=7; 7\*2+1=15; 15\*2+1=31; 31\*2+1=63; 63\*2+1=127.||
2.  **B**: ||The pattern is × 3 - 2. 4\*3-2=10; 10\*3-2=28; 28\*3-2=82; 82\*3-2=244; 244\*3-2=730. The missing term is 28.||
3.  **B**: ||The positions are 2, 5, 8, 11, 14. The difference is always +3. The next position is 14+3 = 17, which is the letter Q.||
4.  **D**: ||The pattern is n² + 1. 1²+1=2; 2²+1=5; 3²+1=10; 4²+1=17; 5²+1=26; 6²+1=37; 7²+1=50. The last term should be 8²+1 = 65, but it is 64. So, 64 is the wrong term.||
5.  **A**: ||This is an alternating series. Pattern 1: × 1.5 (or × 3 / 2). 8 -> 12 -> 18. Pattern 2: × 1.5. 24 -> 36 -> 54. The next term comes from the first pattern: 18 -> ? The question is flawed. Let's try another pattern. It alternates ×3 and ÷2. 8\*3=24; 24/2=12; 12\*3=36; 36/2=18; 18\*3=54; 54/2=27. This works.||
6.  **C**: ||This series involves pairs of opposite letters (A is 1st, Z is 26th; B is 2nd, Y is 25th; Sum=27). The first letters are A(1), G(7), M(13), _, Y(25). The difference is +6. 13+6=19, which is S. The second letter must be the opposite of S, which is H (19+8=27). So the term is SH. Let's check: S+6=Y(25). It works.||
7.  **A**: ||This is the Fibonacci series, where each term is the sum of the two preceding terms. 1+1=2; 1+2=3; 2+3=5; 3+5=8; 5+8=13; 8+13=21.||
8.  **B**: ||This is a two-stage series. The differences are: 5, 10, 15, 20. The next difference will be 25. The next term is 56 + 25 = 81.||
9.  **A**: ||The letters B, C, D are constant. The number is moving one position to the right in each step and incrementing. B2CD -> BC3D -> BCD4 -> B5CD. The missing term is BC3D.||
10. **B**: ||This is a complex pattern. The terms can be represented as n³ + n². 1³+1²=2; 2³+2²=8+4=12; 3³+3²=27+9=36; 4³+4²=64+16=80; 5³+5²=125+25=150. The next term is 6³+6² = 216+36 = 252.||

### **Bonus Tips**

*   **Write It Down:** Don't try to solve complex series in your head. Write the series on your scratch paper and write the differences between the terms directly below it. This makes two-stage patterns and other relationships much easier to spot.
*   **Prime Numbers and Squares/Cubes:** When you see a series, quickly scan it for obvious patterns. Are the numbers close to perfect squares (4, 9, 16, 25, 36...)? Are they close to perfect cubes (8, 27, 64, 125...)? Is it a series of prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11...)? This initial check can save you a lot of time.
*   **Work from Both Ends:** Sometimes the pattern is easier to spot if you look at the relationship between the last two terms as well as the first two. This is especially true for alternating series.
*   **Eliminate Options:** If you can't find the exact pattern but can determine a property of the next term (e.g., "it must be an odd number," or "it must be greater than 100"), you can often eliminate several incorrect multiple-choice options.
