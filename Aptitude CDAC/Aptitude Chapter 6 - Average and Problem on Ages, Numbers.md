You are absolutely right. I apologize again for the formatting inconsistencies. My priority is to provide the notes exactly as you need them. I have now fully understood the two key formatting rules:

1.  **Hide Answers:** The explanation for each MCQ answer must be enclosed in `||...||`.
2.  **Asterisk Formatting:** Any asterisk (`*`) used for multiplication must be escaped with a backslash like this: `\*`.

I will now provide the corrected, final version for Chapter 6, adhering strictly to these two rules. My apologies for the repeated corrections.

### **Quantitative Aptitude | Chapter 6: Average and Problem on Ages, Numbers**

Welcome to Chapter 6. This chapter covers two closely related areas. **Average** is a fundamental statistical measure that gives you a central or typical value for a set of numbers. **Problems on Ages and Numbers** are classic word problems that are often solved using the principles of averages and basic algebra. Mastering averages is crucial as it appears frequently in Data Interpretation sets.

#### **1. Average**

The average (or arithmetic mean) of a set of observations is their sum divided by the number of observations.

**Formula:** `Average = (Sum of Observations) / (Number of Observations)`

This simple formula can be rearranged to find other values, which is often what is required in problems:
*   `Sum of Observations = Average × Number of Observations`
*   `Number of Observations = Sum of Observations / Average`

The second formula is the most powerful tool for solving average problems. **Always think in terms of the SUM.**

**Example: The average age of 30 students is 9 years. If the teacher's age is included, the average becomes 10 years. What is the teacher's age?**
1.  **Initial Sum:** Sum of students' ages = `Average × Number = 9 × 30 = 270` years.
2.  **New Group:** After the teacher is included, the number of people is `30 + 1 = 31`. The new average is 10.
3.  **New Sum:** Sum of ages of students + teacher = `10 × 31 = 310` years.
4.  **Find the Difference:** The increase in the total sum is due to the teacher's age.
    *   Teacher's Age = `(New Sum) - (Initial Sum) = 310 - 270 = 40` years.

**Shortcut for "Inclusion" Problems:**
`Age of New Person = New Average + (Old Number of people × Change in Average)`
In the example above: New Average = 10. Old Number = 30. Change in Average = 10 - 9 = 1.
Teacher's Age = `10 + (30 × 1) = 10 + 30 = 40`.

#### **2. Properties of Averages and Special Cases**

*   **Average of an Arithmetic Progression (AP):** If a set of numbers are in an AP (have a constant difference), the average is simply the middle number, or the average of the first and last numbers.
    *   *Example:* Average of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 is the middle number, **30**.
    *   *Example:* Average of 10, 20, 30, 40 is `(10 + 40) / 2 = 25`.
*   **Consecutive Numbers:** The average of `n` consecutive numbers is `(First Number + Last Number) / 2`.
*   **Weighted Average:** Used when you have subgroups with different averages.
    **Formula:** `Weighted Avg = (n1\*A1 + n2\*A2 + ...) / (n1 + n2 + ...)`
    where `n1`, `n2` are the number of items in each group and `A1`, `A2` are their respective averages.

**Example: The average score of Section A with 20 students is 60, and the average score of Section B with 30 students is 70. Find the combined average.**
*   `Combined Avg = (20\*60 + 30\*70) / (20 + 30)`
*   `= (1200 + 2100) / 50`
*   `= 3300 / 50 = 66`.

#### **3. Problems on Ages**

These are word problems that require you to set up linear equations based on information about people's ages at different points in time.

**The Golden Rule of Ages:**
The **age difference** between two people is **always constant**. If you are 5 years older than your sibling now, you will be 5 years older than them 20 years from now.

**Setting up Equations:**
1.  **Assign variables:** Let the current ages be variables like `x` and `y`.
2.  **Translate statements into equations:**
    *   "5 years ago, A's age was..." -> `(A - 5)`
    *   "10 years hence, B's age will be..." -> `(B + 10)`
    *   "A's age is twice B's age" -> `A = 2B`
    *   "The ratio of their ages is 3:4" -> `A/B = 3/4`

**Example: The ratio of the present ages of A and B is 4:5. Five years from now, the ratio will be 5:6. Find their present ages.**
1.  Let their present ages be `4x` and `5x`.
2.  Five years from now, their ages will be `(4x + 5)` and `(5x + 5)`.
3.  The new ratio is given: `(4x + 5) / (5x + 5) = 5/6`.
4.  Solve the equation by cross-multiplying:
    *   `6(4x + 5) = 5(5x + 5)`
    *   `24x + 30 = 25x + 25`
    *   `x = 5`.
5.  Find their present ages: A's age = `4x = 4\*5 = 20` years. B's age = `5x = 5\*5 = 25` years.

### **Topic Summary & Revision**

*   **Core Average Formula:** `Sum = Average × Number`. Always calculate the sum first.
*   **Inclusion/Exclusion:** Find the initial sum, find the new sum, and the difference is the value of the person/item included or excluded.
*   **Arithmetic Progression:** For evenly spaced numbers, the average is `(First + Last) / 2`.
*   **Ages Problems:** The age difference between people is constant. Translate the word problem into linear equations.
*   **Ratio in Ages:** Assume present ages are multiples of the ratio (e.g., `4x` and `5x`) to set up your equations easily.

**Answer Key**
1.  **C**: ||For 5 consecutive numbers, the average is the middle (3rd) number. So the 3rd number is 21. Since they are consecutive odd numbers, the sequence is 17, 19, 21, 23, 25. The largest is 25.||
2.  **B**: ||The total weight increased by 8 \* 1.5 = 12 kg. This increase is the difference between the new man's weight and the old man's weight. So, New Man's weight = Old Man's weight + Total Increase = 65 + 12 = 77 kg.||
3.  **D**: ||If each number in a set is multiplied by a constant k, the average is also multiplied by k. New average = 7 \* 12 = 84.||
4.  **B**: ||Let their ages be 7x and 3x. Product = (7x) \* (3x) = 21x². Given 21x² = 756 => x² = 756 / 21 = 36 => x = 6. Their present ages are 7\*6=42 and 3\*6=18. After 6 years, their ages will be 42+6=48 and 18+6=24. New ratio = 48:24 = 2:1.||
5.  **B**: ||3 years ago, sum of ages of H, W, C = 27 \* 3 = 81. Present sum of ages = 81 + (3\*3) = 90. 5 years ago, sum of ages of W, C = 20 \* 2 = 40. Present sum of ages of W, C = 40 + (2\*5) = 50. Present age of Husband = (Present sum of H,W,C) - (Present sum of W,C) = 90 - 50 = 40 years.||
6.  **A**: ||Let the average after 10 innings be x. Total runs = 10x. After 11 innings, total runs = 10x + 108. New average = (10x + 108) / 11. We are given that the new average is x+6. So, (10x + 108) / 11 = x + 6 => 10x + 108 = 11x + 66 => x = 42. The old average was 42. The new average is 42 + 6 = 48.||
7.  **C**: ||Let present ages of Father and Son be F and S. F + S = 60. Six years ago, their ages were F-6 and S-6. (F-6) = 5(S-6) => F - 6 = 5S - 30 => F = 5S - 24. Substitute this into the first equation: (5S - 24) + S = 60 => 6S = 84 => S = 14. Son's present age is 14. After 6 years, his age will be 14 + 6 = 20 years.||
8.  **C**: ||Let number of boys be 3k and girls be 1k. Total students = 4k. Use weighted average. Total Sum = (3k \* (A+1)) + (1k \* GirlsAvg). Overall Average = Total Sum / Total Students. A = (3k(A+1) + k\*GirlsAvg) / 4k. Cancel k: 4A = 3(A+1) + GirlsAvg => 4A = 3A + 3 + GirlsAvg => GirlsAvg = A - 3.||
9.  **D**: ||A month of 30 days beginning with a Sunday will have 5 Sundays (days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29) and 25 other days. Total visitors = (5 \* 510) + (25 \* 240) = 2550 + 6000 = 8550. Average visitors per day = Total Visitors / Total Days = 8550 / 30 = 285.||
10. **C**: ||The total age of the 11 players increased by 11 \* 2 = 22 months. This increase is the difference between the sum of ages of the new players and the sum of ages of the replaced players. Sum of replaced players' ages = 18 + 20 = 38 years. Sum of new players' ages = 38 years + 22 months. Average age of new players = (38 years + 22 months) / 2 = 19 years + 11 months.||

### **Bonus Tips**

*   **Deviation Method:** For complex average problems, use the deviation method. Assume an average, find the deviation of each number from that average, and then calculate the average of the deviations. `Actual Average = Assumed Average + Average of Deviations`. This avoids large calculations.
*   **Ages as a Timeline:** Visualize ages problems on a timeline. Mark "Present," "Past" (e.g., 5 years ago), and "Future" (e.g., 10 years hence). This helps keep track of the `+` and `-` operations correctly.
*   **Check for AP:** Always check if a series of numbers is an Arithmetic Progression. If it is, finding the average becomes trivial: `(First + Last) / 2`. This applies to consecutive numbers, consecutive even/odd numbers, or any series with a common difference.
