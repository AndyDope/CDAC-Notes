### **Logical Reasoning | Chapter 15: Clocks and Calendar**

Welcome to Chapter 15. This chapter deals with two distinct but related topics that test your understanding of cyclical patterns and modular arithmetic. **Clocks** problems involve calculating angles between the hands and relative speeds. **Calendar** problems involve finding the day of the week for a given date by understanding leap years and odd days.

---

### **Part 1: Clocks**

A clock is a circle of 360°. The problems almost always involve the minute hand and the hour hand.

### **1. Speed of the Hands**

*   **Hour Hand:**
    *   Covers 360° in 12 hours. Speed = 360/12 = 30° per hour.
    *   Speed = 30° / 60 minutes = **0.5° per minute**.
*   **Minute Hand:**
    *   Covers 360° in 60 minutes. Speed = 360/60 = **6° per minute**.

*   **Relative Speed:** The minute hand is faster than the hour hand.
    *   Relative Speed = `6° - 0.5° = 5.5° per minute`.
    *   This means in one minute, the minute hand gains 5.5° on the hour hand. This is a crucial concept.

### **2. Angle Between the Hands**

This is the most common type of clock problem.

**Formula:**
`Angle θ = | (11/2)M - 30H |`
Where:
*   `H` is the hour.
*   `M` is the minute.
*   The `|...|` means you take the absolute (positive) value.

**Example: What is the angle between the hands of a clock at 4:20?**
*   H = 4, M = 20.
*   `Angle = | (11/2) * 20 - 30 * 4 |`
*   `= | 11 * 10 - 120 |`
*   `= | 110 - 120 | = |-10| = 10°`.

*Note:* Sometimes a question asks for the reflex angle, which would be `360° - 10° = 350°`. Unless specified, give the smaller angle.

### **3. Special Positions of the Hands**

*   **Hands Coincide (0° apart):** The hands are together. This happens **11 times in 12 hours** and 22 times in 24 hours. They gain 360° on each other.
*   **Hands are Opposite (180° apart):** The hands are in a straight line, pointing in opposite directions. This also happens **11 times in 12 hours**.
*   **Hands are at a Right Angle (90° apart):** This happens **22 times in 12 hours** (twice per hour, except at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions).

> **Quick Question:** At what time between 7 and 8 o'clock will the hands of a clock be in a straight line but not together? (i.e., opposite)
> **Answer:** At 7 o'clock, the minute hand is at 12 and the hour hand is at 7. The angle is 210°. To be opposite (180°), the minute hand must gain `210 - 180 = 30°` on the hour hand. Time required = `Degrees to gain / Relative Speed = 30 / 5.5 = 30 / (11/2) = 60/11 = 5 5/11` minutes. So, the time is **5 5/11 minutes past 7**.

---

### **Part 2: Calendar**

Calendar problems revolve around the concept of **odd days**.

### **1. Odd Days**

An "odd day" is a remainder day. It's the number of days more than a complete week.
*   `10 days = 1 week + 3 odd days`.
*   `30 days = 4 weeks + 2 odd days`.
*   `31 days = 4 weeks + 3 odd days`.

**Number of Odd Days in a Year:**
*   **Ordinary Year:** 365 days = 52 weeks + **1 odd day**.
*   **Leap Year:** 366 days = 52 weeks + **2 odd days**.

### **2. Leap Year**

A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.
*   **Exception:** A century year (like 1800, 1900, 2000) is a leap year **only if it is divisible by 400**.
    *   1900 is not a leap year (not divisible by 400).
    *   2000 is a leap year (divisible by 400).

### **3. Finding the Day of the Week**

The method involves counting the total number of odd days from a known reference point.

**Reference:** The number of odd days in centuries.
*   100 years = 76 ordinary years + 24 leap years = 76\*1 + 24\*2 = 76 + 48 = 124 odd days.
*   124 days = 17 weeks + 5 days. So, **100 years have 5 odd days**.
*   200 years = 5 × 2 = 10 days = **3 odd days**.
*   300 years = 5 × 3 = 15 days = **1 odd day**.
*   400 years = (5 × 4) + 1 (for the leap year 400) = 21 days = **0 odd days**.
*   The cycle repeats every 400 years.

**Day Codes:**
*   0 odd days = Sunday
*   1 = Monday
*   2 = Tuesday
*   3 = Wednesday
*   4 = Thursday
*   5 = Friday
*   6 = Saturday

**Example: What was the day of the week on 15th August, 1947?**
1.  **Count years up to 1946:**
    *   Break it down: 1600 years + 300 years + 46 years.
    *   Odd days in 1600 years = 0.
    *   Odd days in 300 years = 1.
    *   Odd days in 46 years: Find leap years in 46 years = `46 / 4 = 11`.
        *   Ordinary years = 46 - 11 = 35.
        *   Odd days = (35 \* 1) + (11 \* 2) = 35 + 22 = 57 days.
        *   57 days = 8 weeks + 1 odd day.
    *   Total odd days up to 1946 = `0 + 1 + 1 = 2`.

2.  **Count days in 1947 up to Aug 15th:**
    *   Jan(3) + Feb(0) + Mar(3) + Apr(2) + May(3) + Jun(2) + Jul(3) + Aug(15)
    *   Sum = 31 days.
    *   31 days = 4 weeks + 3 odd days.

3.  **Total Odd Days:** `2 (from years) + 3 (from months) = 5`.

4.  **Find the Day:** 5 corresponds to **Friday**.

### **==4. Easy trick for the Date-to-Day Calculation Method==**

This method involves a 5-step process to get a final sum, which is then used to find the day of the week. To use this method, you must memorize three sets of codes: **Month Codes**, **Year Codes**, and **Day Codes**.

#### Step 1: Memorize the Codes

##### **a) Month Codes**  
This table gives a unique code for each month of the year.

| **Month** | **Code**<br> |
| :-------: | :----------: |
|     J     |    0<br>     |
|     F     |      3       |
|     M     |      3       |
|     A     |      6       |
|     M     |      1       |
|     J     |      4       |
|     J     |      6       |
|     A     |      2       |
|     S     |      5       |
|     O     |      0       |
|     N     |      3       |
|     D     |      5       |
Mnemonic Tip: You can try to remember this as 033, 614, 625, 035, like a phone number.

##### **b) Year/Century Codes**  
This table provides a code based on the century.

|   Century   | Code |
| :---------: | :--: |
| **1600 – 1699** |  6   |
| **1700 – 1799** |  4   |
| **1800 – 1899** |  2   |
| **1900 – 1999** |  0   |
| **2000 – 2099** |  6   |
**Note:** The pattern repeats every 400 years (6, 4, 2, 0). So, 2100s will be 4, 2200s will be 2, etc.

##### **c) Day Codes (The Final Answer Key)**  
The remainder from our final calculation will map to a day of the week.

| Remainder | Day       |
| --------- | --------- |
| **0**         | Sunday    |
| **1**         | Monday    |
| **2**         | Tuesday   |
| **3**         | Wednesday |
| **4**         | Thursday  |
| **5**         | Friday    |
| **6**         | Saturday  |

#### Step 2: The 5-Part Calculation

For any given date (e.g., 26th January, 1947), you need to find five values and add them together.

1. **Last two digits of the year:** From the year, take the last two digits.
    
2. **Quotient of (Last two digits / 4):** Take the last two digits, divide by 4, and take only the integer part of the result (the quotient). This accounts for leap years.
    
3. **The Date:** The day of the month.
    
4. **The Month Code:** The code for the month from the Month Code table.
    
5. **The Year Code:** The code for the century from the Year Code table.
    

#### Step 3: Find the Remainder

- **Add** the five values you collected in Step 2.
    
- **Divide** the total sum by **7**.
    
- The **remainder** of this division is your final code.
    

#### Step 4: Find the Day

- Match the remainder from Step 3 with the Day Code table to find the day of the week.

### Worked Examples

#### Example 1: What was the day of the week on 26th January, 1947?

1. **Last two digits of year (47):** 47
    
2. **Quotient of (47 / 4):** 11 (since 47 = 4 * 11 + 3)
    
3. **Take the date:** 26
    
4. **Month code (January):** 0
    
5. **Year code (1900-1999):** 0
    **Total Sum:** `47 + 11 + 26 + 0 + 0 = 84`  
    
6. **Divide by 7:** 84 / 7 = 12 with a remainder of 0.
    
7. **Find the day:** A remainder of 0 corresponds to **Sunday**.
    

#### Example 2: What was the day of the week on 15th August, 1947?

1. **Last two digits of year (47):** 47
    
2. **Quotient of (47 / 4):** 11
    
3. **Take the date:** 15
    
4. **Month code (August):** 2
    
5. **Year code (1900-1999):** 0
    **Total Sum:** `47 + 11 + 15 + 2 + 0 = 75`  
    
6. **Divide by 7:** 75 / 7 = 10 with a remainder of 5.
    
7. **Find the day:** A remainder of 5 corresponds to **Friday**.

### The Leap Year Exception

There is one special rule you must remember.

**Rule:** For any date in **January or February** of a **leap year**, you must **subtract 1** from the final remainder.

- A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, unless it is a century year. Century years are only leap years if they are divisible by 400. (e.g., 2000 was a leap year, 1900 was not).
    

#### Example 3: What was the day of the week on 29th February, 2012?

- Check: 2012 is divisible by 4, so it is a leap year. The month is February. The rule applies.
    

1. **Last two digits of year (12):** 12
    
2. **Quotient of (12 / 4):** 3
    
3. **Take the date:** 29
    
4. **Month code (February):** 3
    
5. **Year code (2000-2099):** 6
    **Total Sum:** `12 + 3 + 29 + 3 + 6 = 53`  
    
6. **Divide by 7:** 53 / 7 = 7 with a remainder of 4.
    
7. **Apply Leap Year Rule:** The date is in February of a leap year, so subtract 1 from the remainder. 4 - 1 = 3.
    
8. **Find the day:** A final remainder of 3 corresponds to **Wednesday**.
    

> **Quick Question:** You are calculating the day for 10th March, 2024. Is 2024 a leap year? Do you need to apply the special subtraction rule?  
> **Answer:** 2024 is a leap year. However, the date is in March, not January or February. Therefore, you do **not** apply the subtraction rule.

    <br>

**Answer Key**
1.  **C:**  ||Angle = \|(11/2)\*40 - 30\*3\| = \|11\*20 - 90\| = \|220 - 90\| = 130°.||
2.  **B**: ||The hands are opposite (180° apart) once every hour, but in a 12-hour period, this happens only 11 times (the event between 5 and 7 o'clock happens exactly at 6). In a full day (24 hours), it happens 11 \* 2 = 22 times.||
3.  **D**: ||Years up to 2005: 2000 years (0 odd days) + 5 years. In 5 years, there is 1 leap year (2004). So, 4 ordinary + 1 leap = 4\*1 + 1\*2 = 6 odd days. Days in 2006: Jan(3) + Feb(0) + Mar(3) + Apr(2) + May(28). Sum = 36 days. Odd days = 36 mod 7 = 1. Total odd days = 6 + 1 = 7, which is 0 odd days. 0 corresponds to Sunday.||
4.  **C**: ||Time from noon to 5:10 is 5 hours and 10 minutes. Total minutes = (5 \* 60) + 10 = 310 minutes. The hour hand moves at 0.5° per minute. Total angle turned = 310 \* 0.5 = 155°.||
5.  **C**: ||A century year is a leap year only if it is divisible by 400. 1900 is divisible by 4 but not by 400, so it is not a leap year. 2000 and 1600 are divisible by 400.||
6.  **D**: ||At 4 o'clock, the hands are 20 minute spaces apart. To be opposite, they must be 30 minute spaces apart. The minute hand must gain 20+30=50 minute spaces. The minute hand gains 55 minute spaces in 60 minutes. Time to gain 50 spaces = (60/55) \* 50 = (12/11) \* 50 = 600/11 = 54 6/11 min. past 4.||
7.  **B**: ||Every 7 days, the day repeats. We just need to find the number of odd days in 61. 61 mod 7 = 5 (since 7\*8=56). So the day will be Monday + 5 days = Saturday.||
8.  **B**: ||Total time from Monday noon to next Monday 2 p.m. is 7 days and 2 hours = 170 hours. In this time, the watch gains a total of (2 min) + (4 min 48 sec) = 6 min 48 sec = 6.8 minutes. The watch gains 6.8 min in 170 hrs. It needs to gain 2 minutes to be correct. Time = (170 / 6.8) \* 2 = (1700 / 68) \* 2 = 25 \* 2 = 50 hours. 50 hours after Monday noon is 2 days and 2 hours, which is 2 p.m. on Wednesday.||
9.  **D**: ||For a calendar to repeat, the total number of odd days from the start year must be 0 (mod 7). 2007 (ord) -> 1 odd day. 2008 (leap) -> 2. 2009 (ord) -> 1. 2010 (ord) -> 1. 2011 (ord) -> 1. 2012 (leap) -> 2. Total up to 2012 end = 1+2+1+1+1+2=8 -> 1 odd day. 2013(1), 2014(1), 2015(1), 2016(2), 2017(1). Sum from 2007 to 2017 = 1+2+1+1+1+2+1+1+1+2+1 = 14. Since 14 is divisible by 7, the calendar for 2018 will be the same as 2007.||
10. **C**: ||The hands of a clock coincide 11 times in every 12 hours. In a full day (24 hours), they will coincide 11 \* 2 = 22 times.||
