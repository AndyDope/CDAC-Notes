### **Quantitative Aptitude | Chapter 12: Pipes and Cisterns**

Welcome to Chapter 12. This topic is an exact logical replica of **Time and Work**. The only difference is the terminology. Instead of "men" or "workers," we have "pipes" or "taps." Instead of "building a wall," we have "filling a tank."

*   A pipe filling a tank is doing **positive work**.
*   A leak or an outlet pipe emptying a tank is doing **negative work**.

All the methods, especially the **LCM Method**, apply directly.

### **1. Core Concept: Positive and Negative Work**

The framework is identical to Time and Work.

*   **Total Work:** The capacity of the tank/cistern. We assume this to be the **LCM** of the times given for each pipe.
*   **Efficiency (or Rate):** The volume of water a pipe fills or empties in one unit of time (e.g., litres/hour).
    *   `Rate = Total Capacity / Time Taken`
*   **Inlet Pipe:** A pipe used to fill the tank. It has a **positive (+)** efficiency.
*   **Outlet/Leak Pipe:** A pipe used to empty the tank. It has a **negative (-)** efficiency.

**Combined Efficiency:** When multiple pipes are open, you add their efficiencies (taking care of the signs).

`Combined Rate = (Rate of Inlet 1 + Rate of Inlet 2) - (Rate of Outlet 1)`

### **2. Solving Problems with the LCM Method**

This is the most efficient way to solve these problems.

**Example: Pipe A can fill a tank in 20 minutes and Pipe B can fill it in 30 minutes. If both pipes are opened together, how long will it take to fill the tank?**

1.  **Find Tank Capacity (Total Work):** Times are 20 and 30. `LCM(20, 30) = 60`. Let the **Tank Capacity = 60 litres**.

2.  **Calculate Individual Efficiencies (Rates):**
    *   A's Rate = `Capacity / Time = 60 / 20 = +3 litres/min`.
    *   B's Rate = `Capacity / Time = 60 / 30 = +2 litres/min`.

3.  **Calculate Combined Efficiency:**
    *   Combined Rate (A+B) = `3 + 2 = +5 litres/min`.

4.  **Calculate Time Taken Together:**
    *   `Time = Total Capacity / Combined Rate`
    *   `Time = 60 / 5 = 12` minutes.

**Example with a Leak: A tap can fill a tank in 8 hours. Due to a leak at the bottom, it takes 10 hours to fill the tank. In how many hours can the leak alone empty the full tank?**

1.  **Find Tank Capacity:** Times are 8 and 10. `LCM(8, 10) = 40`. Let **Capacity = 40 litres**.

2.  **Calculate Efficiencies:**
    *   Tap's Efficiency = `40 / 8 = +5 litres/hr`.
    *   Combined (Tap - Leak) Efficiency = `40 / 10 = +4 litres/hr`.

3.  **Find the Leak's Efficiency:**
    *   We know `Tap_Eff - Leak_Eff = Combined_Eff`.
    *   `5 - Leak_Eff = 4`
    *   `Leak_Eff = 5 - 4 = 1 litre/hr`. (The work is positive because we're finding the rate of emptying, the action itself).

4.  **Calculate Time for Leak to Empty:**
    *   `Time = Total Capacity / Leak's Efficiency`
    *   `Time = 40 / 1 = 40` hours.

### **Topic Summary & Revision**

*   **Direct Analogy:** Pipes and Cisterns is Time and Work in disguise.
*   **LCM Method:** Always your first choice. `Total Capacity = LCM` of given times.
*   **Efficiency/Rate:** `Capacity / Time`.
*   **Inlets vs Outlets:** Inlets have positive (+) efficiency. Outlets/leaks have negative (-) efficiency.
*   **Combined Rate:** Sum the efficiencies of all open pipes, respecting their signs.
*   **Final Calculation:** `Time = Total Capacity / Final Combined Rate`.

You are absolutely right to call that out. I apologize. My process for handling a question with potential ambiguity was flawed, and I should have provided a direct, logical answer based on the most reasonable interpretation.

Here is the corrected, final answer key for Chapter 12, adhering strictly to your formatting rules.

**Answer Key**
1.  **B**: ||Total Work = LCM(20,30) = 60. Eff(A)=3, Eff(B)=2. Combined Eff = 5. Time = 60/5 = 12 hours.||
2.  **C**: ||Total Work = LCM(8,16) = 16. Eff(Inlet) = +2. Eff(Outlet) = -1. Combined Eff = 2-1 = 1. Time = 16/1 = 16 hours.||
3.  **C**: ||Total Work = LCM(15,20) = 60. Eff(Pipe) = 60/15 = +4. Eff(Pipe-Leak) = 60/20 = +3. So, 4 - Eff(Leak) = 3 => Eff(Leak) = 1. Time for leak to empty = 60/1 = 60 hours.||
4.  **B**: ||Total Work = LCM(10,12,20) = 60. Eff(A)=+6, Eff(B)=+5, Eff(C)=-3. Combined Eff = 6+5-3 = 8. Time = 60/8 = 7.5 hours. 0.5 hours = 30 minutes. So, 7 hours 30 minutes.||
5.  **C**: ||Ratio of efficiencies: C=2B, B=2A. So C=4A. Eff(A):Eff(B):Eff(C) = 1:2:4. Combined efficiency = 1+2+4 = 7 units/hr. Total Work = Eff \* Time = 7 \* 5 = 35 units. Time for A alone = Total Work / Eff(A) = 35 / 1 = 35 hours.||
6.  **C**: ||Let Capacity = LCM(10,6) = 30 litres. Eff(A) = +3 litres/min. Eff(B) = -5 litres/min. Combined Eff = 3-5 = -2 litres/min. The negative sign means the tank is emptying. The question asks how long it will take to "empty or fill the tank completely". Since the net effect is emptying, we calculate the time to empty. The question is ambiguous about whether to empty the current amount or a full tank. However, emptying a full tank is a standard interpretation. Time to empty a full tank = Total Capacity / Net Rate = 30 / 2 = 15 minutes.||
7.  **A**: ||Total Work = LCM(12,15) = 60. Eff(A)=5, Eff(B)=4. For the first 3 mins, both are open. Work done = (5+4) \* 3 = 27 units. Remaining work = 60 - 27 = 33 units. A is turned off. B does the rest. Time for B = Remaining Work / Eff(B) = 33 / 4 = 8.25 minutes. 0.25 minutes = 15 seconds. So, 8 minutes 15 seconds.||
8.  **C**: ||Let Work = LCM(12,15,20)=60. Eff(A)=5, B=4, C=3. A is always open. B and C work alternately. 1st hour: A+B work = 5+4 = 9 units. 2nd hour: A+C work = 5+3 = 8 units. Work done in a 2-hour cycle = 9+8 = 17 units. We need 60 units. 3 cycles (6 hours) will complete 17 \* 3 = 51 units. Remaining work = 9 units. In the 7th hour, it's A+B's turn. Their combined efficiency is 9. They will complete the remaining 9 units in exactly 1 hour. Total time = 6 hours + 1 hour = 7 hours.||
9.  **D**: ||Let Leak's efficiency be L and Tap's be T. Time for leak to empty = 8 hours. The tap works against the leak, so the emptying time increases to 12 hours. Let Capacity = LCM(8,12) = 24 units. Eff(Leak) = -3 units/hr. Combined Eff(Tap - Leak) = -2 units/hr. So, Eff(Tap) - 3 = -2 => Eff(Tap) = 1 unit/hr. The tap fills 1 unit per hour. We are told the tap admits 6 litres/min, which is 6 \* 60 = 360 litres/hr. So, 1 unit/hr = 360 litres/hr. Total capacity = 24 units = 24 \* 360 = 8640 litres.||
10. **B**: ||Let Capacity = LCM(24,32) = 96 units. Eff(A) = 4 units/min, Eff(B) = 3 units/min. The tank is full in 18 minutes. This means pipe A was open for all 18 minutes. Work done by A = Eff(A) \* Time(A) = 4 \* 18 = 72 units. The remaining work was done by B before it was closed. Remaining work = 96 - 72 = 24 units. Time for which B was open = Work by B / Eff(B) = 24 / 3 = 8 minutes.||

### **Bonus Tips**

*   **Think in Ratios:** Just like in Time & Work, you can solve many problems by focusing on the ratio of efficiencies. If Pipe A fills a tank in 10 hours and Pipe B in 15 hours, the time ratio is 10:15 or 2:3. The efficiency ratio is the inverse, 3:2. This is very fast for wage/cost distribution problems.
*   **Partial Work Shortcut:** For problems like Q6, where the tank is partially full/empty, first find the combined rate of filling/emptying. Then, calculate the amount of work that needs to be done (`Total Capacity - Current Amount` if filling, or `Current Amount` if emptying). Finally, `Time = Work to be done / Combined Rate`.
*   **Visualize the Work:** For alternate-day/hour problems (like Q8), don't get lost in formulas. Simply write down the work done in each time slot. `Hour 1: A+B = 9 units`. `Hour 2: A+C = 8 units`. `Total after 2 hours = 17 units`. This step-by-step approach is less error-prone.
*   **Check Units in Rate Problems:** In problems like Q9 where a real rate (litres/min) is given, the LCM method gives you a "unit" capacity. The key is to find the conversion factor: `1 unit/hour = ? litres/hour`. Once you have this, you can convert the total unit capacity into real litres.
