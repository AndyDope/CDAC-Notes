### **Quantitative Aptitude | Chapter 4: Profit, Loss and Discount**

Welcome to Chapter 4. This is one of the most practical and frequently tested topics in quantitative aptitude. It's a direct application of the concepts we learned in the [[Aptitude Chapter 3 - Percentage|Percentage]] chapter. Every problem in this section revolves around understanding the relationship between three key values: the Cost Price, the Selling Price, and the Marked Price.

---

#### **1. Core Terminology**

Mastering the vocabulary is the first step.

*   **Cost Price (CP):** The price at which an item is purchased or manufactured. This is the base value for all profit and loss calculations.
*   **Selling Price (SP):** The price at which an item is sold.
*   **Profit (or Gain):** Occurs when `SP > CP`.
    *   `Profit = SP - CP`
*   **Loss:** Occurs when `CP > SP`.
    *   `Loss = CP - SP`
*   **Profit/Loss Percentage:** This is **always** calculated with respect to the Cost Price. This is the most important rule in the chapter.
    *   `Profit % = (Profit / CP) * 100`
    *   `Loss % = (Loss / CP) * 100`
*   **Marked Price (MP) / List Price:** The price printed or tagged on an item. It's the price the seller *wants* to sell at, before any discounts.
*   **Discount:** A reduction offered on the Marked Price.
    *   `Discount = MP - SP`
*   **Discount Percentage:** This is **always** calculated with respect to the Marked Price.
    *   `Discount % = (Discount / MP) * 100`

**The Relationship Flowchart:**
`Cost Price (CP) --(Profit/Loss)--> Selling Price (SP) <--(Discount)-- Marked Price (MP)`

#### **2. Calculating SP from CP and Profit/Loss %**

This is a direct application of percentage increase/decrease using the Multiplying Factor (MF) method.

*   For a **profit** of `x%`, the SP is `(100+x)%` of the CP.
    *   `SP = CP * (1 + x/100)`
*   For a **loss** of `x%`, the SP is `(100-x)%` of the CP.
    *   `SP = CP * (1 - x/100)`

**Example: An item was bought for ₹400 and sold at a 20% profit. Find the SP.**
*   Profit = 20%. The MF is `1.20`.
*   `SP = 400 * 1.20 = ₹480`.

**Example: An item was bought for ₹600 and sold at a 15% loss. Find the SP.**
*   Loss = 15%. The MF is `1 - 0.15 = 0.85`.
*   `SP = 600 * 0.85 = ₹510`.

The reverse is also true. To find CP from SP, just divide by the MF.
`CP = SP / MF`

> **Quick Question:** A shopkeeper sells an article for ₹540 at a loss of 10%. What was the cost price?
> **Answer:** Loss of 10% means MF = 0.90. `CP = 540 / 0.90 = ₹600`.

#### **3. Calculating SP from MP and Discount %**

This works exactly the same way, but the base is now the Marked Price.

*   For a **discount** of `d%`, the SP is `(100-d)%` of the MP.
    *   `SP = MP * (1 - d/100)`

**Example: A shirt is marked at ₹1200, and a 25% discount is offered. Find the SP.**
*   Discount = 25%. MF is `1 - 0.25 = 0.75`.
*   `SP = 1200 * 0.75 = ₹900`.
*   (Alternatively, `25% = 1/4`. Discount is `1/4` of 1200 = 300. SP = `1200 - 300 = 900`).

#### **4. The "Mark-up and Discount" Scenario**

This is a very common problem type where a shopkeeper marks up the price from their cost and then offers a discount.

**The Key:** Relate everything back to a single base. Let CP = 100.

**Example: A shopkeeper marks his goods 40% above the cost price and then allows a discount of 25%. Find his gain or loss percent.**
1.  Assume **CP = ₹100**.
2.  He marks it 40% above CP. So, **MP = 100 * 1.40 = ₹140**.
3.  He gives a 25% discount on the MP. `Discount = 25% of 140 = (1/4) * 140 = ₹35`.
4.  Calculate the final SP: **SP = MP - Discount = 140 - 35 = ₹105**.
5.  Now compare the final SP to the original CP.
    *   CP was 100, SP is 105.
    *   The profit is `105 - 100 = ₹5`.
6.  Since our base CP was 100, the profit percent is simply **5%**.

You can also solve this using the successive percentage change formula: `x = +40` (mark-up), `y = -25` (discount).
`Net % Change = 40 - 25 + (40 * -25) / 100 = 15 - 1000/100 = 15 - 10 = +5%`.

### **Topic Summary & Revision**

*   **Base is Key:** Profit/Loss % is always calculated on **CP**. Discount % is always calculated on **MP**.
*   **Multiplying Factor (MF):** Your fastest tool for finding SP from CP or MP.
*   **Profit:** MF > 1 (e.g., 20% profit -> MF = 1.2).
*   **Loss/Discount:** MF < 1 (e.g., 30% loss/discount -> MF = 0.7).
*   **Mark-up Problems:** Assume CP = 100 and work your way through to find the final SP. Then compare it to 100.
*   **Formula:** `SP = CP * (1 ± P/L%) = MP * (1 - D%)`

**Answer Key**
1.  **B**: ||Profit = 600 - 500 = 100. Profit % = (100 / 500) \* 100 = (1/5) \* 100 = 20%.||
<br>
2.  **B**: ||The difference in SP is 400 - 350 = ₹50. This difference in SP is responsible for the 5% increase in loss. So, 5% of CP = 50. This means (1/20) \* CP = 50, so CP = 50 \* 20 = ₹1000.||
<br>
3.  **D**: ||Let CP = 100. He wants 20% profit, so his target SP = 120. This SP of 120 is reached after giving a 20% discount on the MP. So, MP \* (1 - 0.20) = 120 => MP \* 0.80 = 120. MP = 120 / 0.8 = 150. The marked price is 150, which is 50% above the cost price of 100.||
<br>
4.  **B**: ||This is a false weight problem. The shopkeeper's cost is for 900g, but he sells it at the price of 1000g. Let the CP of 1g be ₹1. CP = ₹900. SP = ₹1000. Profit = 100. Profit % = (100 / 900) \* 100 = (1/9) \* 100 = 11.11%.||
<br>
5.  **A**: ||We can work backward from the SP. A 12.5% discount means selling at 87.5% (or 7/8) of MP. So, MP \* (7/8) = 1050. MP = 1050 \* 8 / 7 = 150 \* 8 = 1200.||
<br>
6.  **D**: ||Best method: Find CP and SP of 1 article. CP of 1 article = 10/12. SP of 1 article = 12/10. Profit = SP - CP = 12/10 - 10/12 = (144-100)/120 = 44/120. Profit % = (Profit / CP) \* 100 = ( (44/120) / (10/12) ) \* 100 = (44/120 \* 12/10) \* 100 = (44/100) \* 100 = 44%.||
<br>
7.  **C**: ||When SP is the same for two items, one sold at x% gain and the other at x% loss, there is always a net loss. The formula for the net loss is (x²/100)%. Here, x=20. Net loss = (20² / 100)% = (400 / 100)% = 4% loss.||
<br>
8.  **D**: ||Given 15 \* CP = 12 \* SP. Rearrange to find the ratio SP / CP = 15 / 12 = 5 / 4. This means if CP is 4, SP is 5. Profit is 1. Profit % = (1/4) \* 100 = 25% gain.||
<br>
9.  **C**: ||Let CP = 720. He wants 15% profit. Target SP = 720 \* 1.15 = 828. This SP of 828 is reached after a 10% discount on MP. So, MP \* 0.90 = 828. MP = 828 / 0.9 = 920. The intended answer is C.||
<br>
10. **C**: ||Use multiplying factors. Let initial value be 100. After 10% discount, value is 100 \* 0.9 = 90. After another 20% discount, value is 90 \* 0.8 = 72. After a final 30% discount, value is 72 \* 0.7 = 50.4. The final price is 50.4. The total discount is 100 - 50.4 = 49.6%.||
