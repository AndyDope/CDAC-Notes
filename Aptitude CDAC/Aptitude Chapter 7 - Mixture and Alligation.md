### **Quantitative Aptitude | Chapter 7: Mixture and Alligation**

Welcome to Chapter 7. This topic is about mixing two or more ingredients in a certain ratio to create a mixture with a desired quality or price. **Alligation** is a powerful visual shortcut used to solve these problems quickly. It helps you find the ratio in which two ingredients must be mixed to get a mixture of a mean value.

This rule is extremely versatile and can be applied to problems involving prices, percentages, speeds, and more.

### **1. The Concept of Mixture**

A mixture is what you get when you combine two or more items. The problems typically involve:
*   Mixing two varieties of an item (like tea, rice, or sugar) with different prices.
*   Mixing a pure liquid (like milk or acid) with water.
*   Finding the final concentration or price of a mixture.
*   Finding the ratio in which to mix items to achieve a target price or concentration.

The fundamental principle is that the total value of the mixture is the sum of the values of its components.
`(Quantity of item 1 × Price of item 1) + (Quantity of item 2 × Price of item 2) = Total Quantity × Mean Price`

### **2. The Rule of Alligation**

Alligation is a graphical method to find the ratio in which two ingredients must be mixed.

**The Setup:**
1.  Write the price/value of the "Cheaper" ingredient on the left.
2.  Write the price/value of the "Dearer" (more expensive) ingredient on the right.
3.  Write the desired "Mean" price/value in the center.
4.  Subtract diagonally and write the positive difference at the corners.

```
  (Value of Cheaper)        (Value of Dearer)
         C                          D
              \                /
               (Mean Value)
                    M
              /                \
   (D - M)         :         (M - C)
```

The result `(D - M) : (M - C)` is the **ratio of the quantities** in which the cheaper and dearer ingredients must be mixed.

**Example: In what ratio must a grocer mix two varieties of tea, one costing ₹60/kg and another costing ₹65/kg, so that by selling the mixture at ₹68.20/kg, he may gain 10%?**

1.  **Find the Cost Price of the mixture:** The selling price (SP) is ₹68.20, and the profit is 10%. We must use the cost price for alligation.
    *   `CP_mixture = SP / (1 + Profit%) = 68.20 / 1.10 = ₹62`.
    *   This is our **Mean Price (M)**.

2.  **Set up the alligation diagram:**
    *   Cheaper (C) = 60
    *   Dearer (D) = 65
    *   Mean (M) = 62

    ```
      Cheaper(60)              Dearer(65)
           \                    /
              Mean Price (62)
           /                    \
    (65 - 62)       :       (62 - 60)
         3          :           2
    ```

3.  **Result:** The grocer must mix the cheaper and dearer tea in the ratio **3:2**.

> **Quick Question:** A mixture of 30 litres of milk and water contains 10% water. How much water should be added to make the water 20% in the new mixture?
> **Answer:** This can be solved with alligation on the *concentration of water*.
> Original mixture has 10% water. The water being added is 100% water. We want the final mixture to have 20% water.
> `Cheaper(10%)`, `Dearer(100%)`, `Mean(20%)`.
> Ratio = `(100-20) : (20-10) = 80:10 = 8:1`.
> This means for every 8 parts of the original mixture, 1 part of water must be added.
> The original mixture is 30 litres (8 parts). So, `8 parts = 30 litres`. `1 part = 30/8 = 3.75 litres`.
> We need to add 1 part of water, so **3.75 litres** should be added.

### **3. Problems Involving Repeated Dilution / Replacement**

This is a common variation where a certain quantity of a solution is removed and replaced with another liquid (usually water), and this process is repeated multiple times.

**Formula:**
`Final Amount of Pure Liquid = Initial Amount × ( 1 - (Quantity Removed / Total Volume) )^n`
where `n` is the number of times the process is repeated.

**Example: A container contains 40 litres of milk. From this container, 4 litres of milk were taken out and replaced by water. This process was repeated two more times (total of 3 times). How much milk is now in the container?**

1.  Initial Amount = 40 litres.
2.  Quantity Removed = 4 litres.
3.  Total Volume = 40 litres.
4.  Number of repetitions (n) = 3.

5.  Apply the formula:
    *   `Final Milk = 40 × ( 1 - (4 / 40) )³`
    *   `= 40 × ( 1 - 1/10 )³`
    *   `= 40 × ( 9/10 )³`
    *   `= 40 × (729 / 1000)`
    *   `= 29160 / 1000 = 29.16` litres.

### **Topic Summary & Revision**

*   **Alligation is a Tool for Ratios:** Alligation is a visual shortcut to find the ratio in which two items with different "values" (price, concentration, etc.) should be mixed to get a desired "mean value".
*   **Use Consistent Units:** All three values in the alligation diagram (Cheaper, Dearer, Mean) must be of the same type. If you are mixing items, use their **Cost Prices**, not Selling Prices (unless the problem states otherwise). If mixing solutions, use their **concentrations** (e.g., % of milk, % of acid).
*   **Repeated Dilution Formula:** `Final = Initial * (1 - Removed/Total)^n`. Memorize this formula for replacement problems.

**Answer Key**
1.  **A**: ||Using Alligation: Cheaper=9.30, Dearer=10.80, Mean=10. Ratio = (10.80 - 10) : (10 - 9.30) = 0.80 : 0.70 = 8:7.||
2.  **B**: ||Using the formula: Final Milk = 50 \* (1 - 5/50)² = 50 \* (1 - 1/10)² = 50 \* (81/100) = 4050/100 = 40.5 litres.||
3.  **A**: ||A gain of 25% means a profit of 1/4. In these problems, CP is the pure milk and the profit comes from the water added. So, (Water/Milk) = 1/4. The total mixture is 1+4=5 parts. Percentage of water = (Water/Total Mixture) \* 100 = (1/5) \* 100 = 20%.||
4.  **C**: ||When 9 litres of the mixture are drawn off, the ratio remains 7:5. Let the remaining quantities be 7x and 5x. Then 9 litres of B are added. So, (7x) / (5x + 9) = 7/9. Cross-multiply: 63x = 35x + 63 => 28x = 63 => x = 63/28 = 9/4. The total volume of the remaining mixture was 7x + 5x = 12x = 12 \* (9/4) = 27 litres. Since 9 litres were drawn off, the initial total volume was 27 + 9 = 36 litres. Initial quantity of A = (7/12) \* 36 = 21 litres.||
5.  **A**: ||First, convert all values to the fraction of milk. Mixture A: Milk is 8/13. Mixture B: Milk is 5/7. Mean Mixture: 69 3/13 % = 900/13 % = (900/13)/100 = 9/13. Now use alligation: (5/7 - 9/13) : (9/13 - 8/13) = ((65-63)/91) : (1/13) = (2/91) : (1/13). Multiply by 91 to simplify: 2 : 7.||
6.  **C**: ||Use Alligation on the profit percentages. Cheaper(8%), Dearer(18%), Mean(14%). Ratio = (18-14) : (14-8) = 4:6 = 2:3. This is the ratio of quantities. The total quantity is 100 kg. Quantity sold at 18% profit (which corresponds to the '3' part of the ratio) = (3/5) \* 100 = 60 kg.||
7.  **D**: ||First, find the CP of the mixture. SP = 9.24, Profit = 10%. CP = 9.24 / 1.1 = 8.4. Now use alligation. Cheaper(7), Dearer(9), Mean(8.4). Ratio of Qty(Dearer) : Qty(Cheaper) = (8.4 - 7) : (9 - 8.4) = 1.4 : 0.6 = 14:6 = 7:3. So, Qty(Dearer)/Qty(Cheaper) = 7/3. We have 27 kg of the cheaper sugar. Qty(Dearer)/27 = 7/3. Qty(Dearer) = 27 \* 7 / 3 = 9 \* 7 = 63 kg.||
8.  **B**: ||Initial ratio Wine:Water = 3:1. Fraction of wine = 3/4. Let x be the fraction of the mixture drawn off. The final concentration of wine = Initial Conc. \* (1-x). We want the final ratio to be 1:1, so the final wine fraction should be 1/2. 1/2 = (3/4) \* (1-x). (1/2) \* (4/3) = 1-x => 2/3 = 1-x => x = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.||
9.  **A**: ||Initial milk concentration is 80%. The added liquid is pure water (0% milk). The final mixture has milk 50% more than water (M=1.5W), so the ratio M:W is 3:2. The final milk concentration is 3/5 = 60%. Use alligation on the items being mixed: (Mixture Remaining) and (Water Added). Alligate on milk %. Mix1=80% milk. Mix2=0% milk. Final=60% milk. Ratio of (Qty of Mix1) : (Qty of Mix2) = (60-0) : (80-60) = 60:20 = 3:1. The final 80L mixture consists of 3 parts of original mixture and 1 part of water. Total 4 parts = 80L, so 1 part = 20L. The water added is 1 part, so 20L. This means 20L of the mixture was taken out.||
10. **B**: ||Initial mixture = 729 ml. Ratio M:W = 7:2. Total parts = 9. 1 part = 729/9 = 81 ml. Initial Milk = 7 \* 81 = 567 ml. Initial Water = 2 \* 81 = 162 ml. Let 'x' ml of water be added. The amount of milk remains constant. New ratio = 567 / (162 + x) = 7/3. Cross-multiply: 567 \* 3 = 7 \* (162 + x). Divide by 7: 81 \* 3 = 162 + x => 243 = 162 + x => x = 81 ml.||
