### **Quantitative Aptitude | Chapter 10: Boats & Streams, Races**

Welcome to Chapter 10. This chapter covers two distinct applications of the Speed, Distance, and Time principles. **Boats and Streams** problems are all about understanding how the speed of a current (stream) affects the speed of a moving object (boat). **Races** are problems that test your understanding of relative distances and times between competitors.

### **Part 1: Boats and Streams**

This entire topic hinges on one simple idea:
*   When a boat travels with the stream, the stream's speed helps the boat, so their speeds add up.
*   When a boat travels against the stream, the stream's speed hinders the boat, so their speeds subtract.

#### **1. Core Terminology**

*   **Speed of the boat in still water (B):** The boat's own speed without any current. This is usually what you are asked to find.
*   **Speed of the stream/current (S):** The speed of the water flow.
*   **Downstream Speed (D):** The effective speed of the boat when it travels *with* the current.
    *   `D = B + S`
*   **Upstream Speed (U):** The effective speed of the boat when it travels *against* the current.
    *   `U = B - S`

**The Two Magic Formulas:**
Most problems will give you the downstream and upstream speeds (or information to calculate them) and ask for the boat's speed or the stream's speed. These two formulas are essential shortcuts:

1.  **Speed of Boat in Still Water (B) = (Downstream Speed + Upstream Speed) / 2`**
    *   `B = (D + U) / 2`
2.  **Speed of Stream (S) = (Downstream Speed - Upstream Speed) / 2`**
    *   `S = (D - U) / 2`

**Example: A boat travels downstream at 20 km/hr and upstream at 12 km/hr. Find the speed of the boat in still water and the speed of the stream.**
*   `D = 20`, `U = 12`.
*   Speed of Boat (B) = `(20 + 12) / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16 km/hr`.
*   Speed of Stream (S) = `(20 - 12) / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4 km/hr`.
*   *Verification:* `B+S = 16+4 = 20` (Downstream). `B-S = 16-4 = 12` (Upstream). Correct.
> **Quick Question (Corrected):** A man can row a boat at 10 km/hr in still water. If the speed of the stream is 3 km/hr, how long will it take him to row 35 km upstream?
> **Answer:** Upstream Speed `U = B - S = 10 - 3 = 7 km/hr`.
> Time = `Distance / Speed = 35 / 7 = 5` hours.

### **Part 2: Races**

Race problems are about comparing the performance of two or more competitors. They involve concepts like "head starts" or "beating by" a certain distance or time.

#### **1. Core Concepts in Races**

*   **"A gives B a start of x meters":** This means B starts `x` meters ahead of the starting line. A has to cover the full race distance, while B has to cover `(Race Distance - x)`.
*   **"A beats B by x meters":** In the same amount of time, A has finished the race, while B is still `x` meters behind the finish line. This implies that A has run `x` meters more than B in that time.
*   **"A beats B by t seconds":** A finishes the race, and B takes `t` more seconds to reach the finish line.
*   **Dead Heat:** A race where both competitors finish at the exact same time.

The key to solving these problems is the fact that in a race, the **time is constant** for comparison when someone "beats" another by a distance.

**Example: In a 100m race, A runs at 5 m/s. If A gives B a start of 4m and still beats him by 4 seconds, what is the speed of B?**

1.  **Analyze A's performance:**
    *   Time taken by A to run 100m = `Distance / Speed = 100 / 5 = 20` seconds.

2.  **Analyze B's performance:**
    *   A beats B by 4 seconds. This means B takes 4 seconds longer than A to finish his race.
    *   Time taken by B = `Time_A + 4 = 20 + 4 = 24` seconds.
    *   A gives B a start of 4m. This means B only has to run `100 - 4 = 96` meters.

3.  **Calculate B's speed:**
    *   Speed of B = `Distance_B / Time_B = 96 / 24 = 4 m/s`.

### **Topic Summary & Revision**

*   **Boats & Streams:**
    *   Downstream: `D = B + S` (Speeds add up)
    *   Upstream: `U = B - S` (Speeds subtract)
    *   To find Boat speed: `B = (D + U) / 2`
    *   To find Stream speed: `S = (D - U) / 2`
*   **Races:**
    *   "Beats by x meters": In the same time, the winner ran the full distance while the loser ran `(full distance - x)`.
    *   "Beats by t seconds": The loser takes `t` seconds more to cover the full distance.
    *   "Start of x meters": The person given the start has to run `(full distance - x)`.
*   **Ratio of Speeds:** In any race, if time is constant, the ratio of distances covered is equal to the ratio of their speeds. `D_A / D_B = S_A / S_B`.

**Answer Key**
1.  **C**: ||Downstream speed D = B + S = 13 + 4 = 17 km/hr. Time = Distance / Speed = 68 / 17 = 4 hours.||
2.  **C**: ||Downstream speed = 15+3=18 km/hr. Upstream speed = 15-3=12 km/hr. Distance downstream = 18 \* 3 = 54 km. Distance upstream = 12 \* 3 = 36 km. Total distance = 54 + 36 = 90 km.||
3.  **B**: ||When A finishes in 10s, B is still running. B's speed = 100m / 12s. In 10s, B covers a distance of Speed \* Time = (100/12) \* 10 = 83.33 meters. A beats B by 100 - 83.33 = 16.67 or 16.66 m.||
4.  **B**: ||Since distance is constant, the ratio of speeds is the inverse of the ratio of times. T_up / T_down = 2/1. Therefore, S_down / S_up = 2/1. (B+S)/(B-S) = 2/1. B+S = 2(B-S) => B+S = 2B - 2S => B = 3S. Given S=3 km/hr, B = 3 \* 3 = 9 km/hr.||
5.  **B**: ||Downstream speed D = 16 km / 2 hr = 8 km/hr. Upstream speed U = 16 km / 4 hr = 4 km/hr. Speed of boat in still water B = (D + U) / 2 = (8 + 4) / 2 = 6 km/hr.||
6.  **C**: ||The question contains contradictory information. However, the most likely intended interpretation that yields an answer is: B gives A a start of 140m (so A runs 360m, B runs 500m) and the ratio of speeds is A:B = 4:3. In the time it takes B to run 500m (T = 500/3k), A runs a distance of 4k \* (500/3k) = 666.67m. Since A only had to run 360m, A finished long ago. Let's find the time A takes: T_A = 360/4k = 90/k. In this time, B runs a distance of 3k \* (90/k) = 270m. B has 500-270=230m left to run. This does not match. Let's try the only other logical interpretation: A gives B a start of 140m. A runs 500m, B runs 360m. Speeds A:B = 4:3. Time for A to run 500m is T = 500/4k = 125/k. In this time, B runs 3k \* (125/k) = 375m. B needed to run 360m. B finished earlier. The question is flawed as written. The only scenario that resolves to an answer is assuming a typo in the ratio: If ratio A:B is 3:4 and B gives A a start of 140m (A runs 360m, B runs 500m). Time for A to finish is T=360/3k=120/k. In that time, B runs 4k\*(120/k)=480m. B has 20m left. So A wins by 20m.||
7.  **C**: ||Let 1/U=x, 1/D=y. Eq1: 30x+44y=10. Eq2: 40x+55y=13. Multiply first by 4, second by 3: 120x+176y=40 and 120x+165y=39. Subtracting gives 11y=1, so y=1/11 => D=11 km/hr. Substitute y back: 30x + 44(1/11) = 10 => 30x+4=10 => 30x=6 => x=1/5 => U=5 km/hr. Speed of boat B = (D+U)/2 = (11+5)/2 = 8 km/hr.||
8.  **B**: ||B is beaten by 28m or 7 seconds. This implies B takes 7 seconds to cover 28m. B's speed = 28/7 = 4 m/s. Time for B to run the full 1000m = 1000/4 = 250 seconds. A beats B by 7 seconds, so A's time = 250 - 7 = 243 seconds. 243 seconds is 4 minutes and 3 seconds.||
9.  **A**: ||Let speed of stream be S. The best way is to test the options. Try S=2. Downstream speed D=12, Upstream speed U=8. Time Upstream = 36/8 = 4.5 hr. Time Downstream = 36/12 = 3 hr. The difference is 1.5 hours, which is 90 minutes. This matches the condition. So S=2 km/hr.||
10. **B**: ||When A runs 1000m, B runs 960m. When A runs 1000m, C runs 936m. The ratio of distances covered by B and C in the same time is 960:936. We want to find how much start B can give C in a 1000m race. This means when B runs 1000m, where is C? C's distance = (936/960) \* 1000 = (39/40) \* 1000 = 39 \* 25 = 975m. So, B can give C a start of 1000 - 975 = 25m.||

### **Bonus Tips**

*   **Proportionality is Everything:** Most problems can be solved faster using ratios and proportions than by setting up complex D=S\*T equations.
    *   If Time is constant, `Distance ∝ Speed`.
    *   If Distance is constant, `Speed ∝ 1/Time`.
    *   If Speed is constant, `Distance ∝ Time`.
*   **Boats & Streams Shortcut:** The ratio of `Downstream Speed / Upstream Speed` is equal to the ratio of `Upstream Time / Downstream Time` for the same distance. For Q4: `T_U / T_D = 2/1`. So, `D/U = 2/1` => `(B+S)/(B-S) = 2/1`. This gives `B+S = 2B-2S` => `B=3S`, which is much faster.
*   **Train Problems Mental Checklist:**
    1.  What is the total distance? (Sum of lengths of train and platform/other train).
    2.  What is the relative speed? (Add for opposite, subtract for same direction).
    3.  Are units consistent? (Convert everything to m/s or km/hr).
    4.  Apply `Time = Distance / Speed`.
*   **Race Head-Start Logic:** A gives B a start of `x` meters in a `D` meter race. This means a ratio of distances covered is `D : (D-x)`. The ratio of their speeds will be the same, `S_A : S_B = D : (D-x)`. This can simplify many problems.
