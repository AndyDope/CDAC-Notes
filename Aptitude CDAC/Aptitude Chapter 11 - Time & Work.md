### **Quantitative Aptitude | Chapter 11: Time & Work**

Welcome to Chapter 11. Time and Work problems deal with the efficiency of individuals or groups and the time they take to complete a task. The core concept revolves around calculating the amount of "work" done by a person in one unit of time (their "rate" or "efficiency").

This is a logical topic that can be solved very quickly using the "Unitary Method" or the "LCM Method," which we will focus on.

#### **1. Core Concept: Work, Time, and Efficiency**

The fundamental relationship is:
`Work = Efficiency × Time`

*   **Work:** The total task to be completed (e.g., building a wall, filling a tank). We often assume the total work is a single "unit" or a value derived from the LCM of the times given.
*   **Time:** The time taken to complete the work.
*   **Efficiency (or Rate of Work):** The amount of work a person does in one unit of time (e.g., per day, per hour).
    *   `Efficiency = Total Work / Time Taken`

**The Inverse Relationship:**
If the work is constant, efficiency is inversely proportional to the time taken.
`Efficiency ∝ 1 / Time`
This means if someone is twice as efficient, they will take half the time to complete the same job. The ratio of efficiencies of A and B is the inverse of the ratio of the time they take.
`Efficiency_A / Efficiency_B = Time_B / Time_A`

#### **2. The LCM Method (The Best Method)**

Instead of working with fractions (e.g., A does 1/10 of the work per day), it's much easier to assume the **Total Work** is the LCM (Least Common Multiple) of the times given for all individuals.

**Example: A can do a piece of work in 10 days and B can do it in 15 days. In how many days will they complete the work together?**

1.  **Find Total Work:** The times given are 10 and 15. `LCM(10, 15) = 30`. Let's assume the **Total Work = 30 units** (e.g., making 30 chairs).

2.  **Calculate Individual Efficiencies (Work per day):**
    *   A's Efficiency = `Total Work / A's Time = 30 / 10 = 3 units/day`.
    *   B's Efficiency = `Total Work / B's Time = 30 / 15 = 2 units/day`.

3.  **Calculate Combined Efficiency:**
    *   When working together, their efficiencies add up.
    *   Combined Efficiency (A+B) = `3 + 2 = 5 units/day`.

4.  **Calculate Time Taken Together:**
    *   `Time = Total Work / Combined Efficiency`
    *   `Time = 30 / 5 = 6` days.

This method avoids all fractions and makes the logic clear.

> **Quick Question:** A can do a job in 12 days, B in 24 days. If they work together, how many days will it take?
> **Answer:** LCM(12, 24) = 24 units. A's rate = 24/12 = 2. B's rate = 24/24 = 1. Combined rate = 3. Time = 24/3 = 8 days.

#### **3. Work and Wages**

The principle here is simple: **Wages are distributed in the ratio of the work done by each individual.**

If they work for the same amount of time, the wages are distributed in the ratio of their efficiencies.

**Example: A can do a piece of work in 6 days and B in 8 days. They work together and complete it, earning ₹2800. What is B's share?**

1.  **Find the ratio of their efficiencies.**
    *   Ratio of Time (A:B) = `6:8 = 3:4`.
    *   Ratio of Efficiencies (A:B) = `4:3` (inverse of time ratio).
2.  **Distribute wages in the ratio of efficiency.**
    *   Total ratio parts = `4 + 3 = 7`.
    *   7 parts correspond to ₹2800. So, 1 part = `2800 / 7 = ₹400`.
    *   B's share is 3 parts: `3 \* 400 = ₹1200`.

#### **4. The `M-D-H` Formula**

This is used for problems involving groups of people, working for a certain number of days and hours.

**The Formula:**
`(M₁ × D₁ × H₁) / W₁ = (M₂ × D₂ × H₂) / W₂`
Where:
*   M = Number of Men (or workers)
*   D = Number of Days
*   H = Hours per day
*   W = Amount of Work (often 1 unit if the work is the same)

If any component (like Hours) is not mentioned, you can omit it from the formula.

**Example: 12 men can complete a piece of work in 8 days. How many men are required to complete the same work in 6 days?**
*   Here, H and W are constant. The formula becomes `M₁D₁ = M₂D₂`.
*   `12 \* 8 = M₂ \* 6`
*   `96 = 6 \* M₂`
*   `M₂ = 96 / 6 = 16` men.

### **Topic Summary & Revision**

*   **The LCM Method is King:** For almost all problems involving individuals, assume `Total Work = LCM` of the given times. This turns the problem into simple integer arithmetic.
*   **Calculate Efficiencies:** `Efficiency = Total Work / Time`. This is the work done per unit of time.
*   **Combined Work:** When working together, add their efficiencies. When working against each other (e.g., one building, one destroying), subtract their efficiencies.
*   **Wages:** Are always shared in the ratio of the work done, which is the same as the ratio of their efficiencies if they work for the same duration.
*   **Group Work:** Use the `MDH/W` formula. Ensure you correctly identify `M₁`, `D₁`, `W₁`, etc.

**Answer Key**
1.  **C**: ||Let Total Work = LCM(16, 12, 4) = 48 units. Eff(A) = 48/16 = 3. Eff(B) = 48/12 = 4. Eff(A+B+C) = 48/4 = 12. Eff(C) = Eff(A+B+C) - Eff(A) - Eff(B) = 12 - 3 - 4 = 5 units/day. Time for C alone = Total Work / Eff(C) = 48 / 5 = 9.6 days.||
2.  **B**: ||Let Total Work = LCM(72, 120, 90) = 360 units. Eff(A+B) = 360/72 = 5. Eff(B+C) = 360/120 = 3. Eff(A+C) = 360/90 = 4. Adding them all: 2(A+B+C) = 5+3+4 = 12. So, Eff(A+B+C) = 6. We want Eff(A) = Eff(A+B+C) - Eff(B+C) = 6 - 3 = 3 units/day. Time for A alone = 360 / 3 = 120 days.||
3.  **B**: ||A is twice as good as B, so the ratio of efficiencies Eff(A):Eff(B) = 2:1. Combined efficiency = 2+1 = 3 units/day. Total Work = Combined Efficiency \* Time = 3 \* 14 = 42 units. Time for A alone = Total Work / Eff(A) = 42 / 2 = 21 days.||
4.  **C**: ||From the first statement, 10 men in 10 days is equivalent to 100 man-days. From the second, 12 women in 10 days is 120 woman-days. So, 100 man-days = 120 woman-days => 10 Men = 12 Women, or 5 Men = 6 Women. We need 15 men and 6 women. Convert women to men: 6 women = 5 men. So the total workforce is 15 men + 5 men = 20 men. The work takes 10 men 10 days. Using M1D1 = M2D2: 10 \* 10 = 20 \* D2 => 100 = 20 \* D2 => D2 = 5 days.||
5.  **C**: ||Let Total Work = LCM(4, 3, 2) = 12 units. Eff(A) = 12/4 = 3. Eff(B+C) = 12/3 = 4. Eff(A+C) = 12/2 = 6. We want Eff(B). First find Eff(C) = Eff(A+C) - Eff(A) = 6 - 3 = 3. Now find Eff(B) = Eff(B+C) - Eff(C) = 4 - 3 = 1 unit/hour. Time for B alone = Total Work / Eff(B) = 12 / 1 = 12 hours.||
6.  **A**: ||A is twice as fast, so A takes half the time. If B takes 12 days, A takes 6 days. Now solve together: Total Work = LCM(12, 6) = 12 units. Eff(A)=2, Eff(B)=1. Combined Eff = 3. Time = 12 / 3 = 4 days.||
7.  **B**: ||Wages are paid in the ratio of work done (or efficiency). Let Total Work = LCM(6, 8, 3) = 24 units. Eff(A) = 24/6 = 4. Eff(B) = 24/8 = 3. Eff(A+B+C) = 24/3 = 8. Eff(C) = 8 - 4 - 3 = 1. The ratio of efficiencies A:B:C is 4:3:1. C's share of wages = (C's ratio part / Total ratio parts) \* Total Wages = (1 / (4+3+1)) \* 3200 = (1/8) \* 3200 = ₹400.||
8.  **A**: ||Let M be a man's one-day work and B be a boy's. Total Work = (6M+8B) \* 10 = (26M+48B) \* 2. 60M + 80B = 52M + 96B => 8M = 16B => 1M = 2B. The efficiency ratio of a man to a boy is 2:1. Convert everything to one unit (e.g., boys). 1M=2B. Total Work = (6(2B)+8B) \* 10 = (12B+8B) \* 10 = 20B \* 10 = 200 boy-days. Now find the time for 15 men and 20 boys. Workforce = 15(2B) + 20B = 30B + 20B = 50B. Time = Total Work / Workforce = 200 boy-days / 50 boys = 4 days.||
9.  **C**: ||Total Work = LCM(15, 10) = 30 units. Eff(A) = 2, Eff(B) = 3. They work together for 2 days. Work done = (2+3) \* 2 = 10 units. Remaining work = 30 - 10 = 20 units. A alone does this remaining work. Time taken by A = Remaining Work / Eff(A) = 20 / 2 = 10 days. Total time for the whole work = 2 days (together) + 10 days (A alone) = 12 days.||
10. **B**: ||Let the number of men originally employed be M. The work was supposed to take M men 9 days. So, Total Work = M \* 9. But 6 men were absent, so (M-6) men worked. They took 15 days. So, Total Work = (M-6) \* 15. The work is the same. 9M = 15(M-6) => 9M = 15M - 90 => 6M = 90 => M = 15.||

### **Bonus Tips**

*   **Negative Work:** Some problems involve one person building and another destroying (or a leak in a tank). Treat the destructive work as negative efficiency. If A builds 5 units/hr and B destroys 2 units/hr, their combined efficiency is `5 - 2 = 3` units/hr.
*   **Alternate Days:** If A and B work on alternate days, calculate the work done in a 2-day cycle. For example, if A starts, work in 2 days = `Eff(A) + Eff(B)`. Divide the total work by this cycle work to see how many full cycles are needed, then handle the remaining work manually.
*   **Efficiency Ratio is Key:** Many problems can be solved instantly if you focus on the ratio of efficiencies. If A is 50% more efficient than B, `Eff(A) = 1.5 * Eff(B)`. The ratio Eff(A):Eff(B) is 1.5:1 or 3:2. This means the time taken ratio will be the inverse, 2:3.
*   **Check the Question:** After solving, always re-read the question. Does it ask for the time for the *whole* work or the *remaining* work? Does it ask for A's share or B's share? This is a common place to make a silly mistake.
