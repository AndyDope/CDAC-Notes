### **Quantitative Aptitude | Chapter 3: Percentage**

Welcome to Chapter 3. Percentage is one of the most important chapters in all of quantitative aptitude. The concepts you learn here are the building blocks for numerous other topics, including Profit & Loss, Simple & Compound Interest, and especially Data Interpretation.

The word "per-cent" comes from the Latin *per centum*, which means "by the hundred." A percentage is simply a fraction with a denominator of 100. Mastering the conversion between percentages, fractions, and decimals is the key to solving these problems with great speed.

### **1. Core Concept: Percentage-Fraction-Decimal Conversion**

This is the most crucial skill for this chapter. Direct calculations with percentages are often slow. Converting them to fractions first is a game-changer.

*   **Percentage to Fraction:** Divide by 100.
    *   `40% = 40 / 100 = 4/10 = 2/5`
*   **Fraction to Percentage:** Multiply by 100.
    *   `3/4 = (3/4) * 100% = 75%`

**Memorize This Table!**
Committing these common fractions to memory will drastically increase your calculation speed.

| Fraction | Percentage | Decimal |
| :------- | :--------- | :------ |
| 1/1      | 100%       | 1.0     |
| 1/2      | 50%        | 0.5     |
| 1/3      | 33.33%     | 0.333   |
| 1/4      | 25%        | 0.25    |
| 1/5      | 20%        | 0.2     |
| 1/6      | 16.66%     | 0.166   |
| 1/7      | 14.28%     | 0.1428  |
| 1/8      | 12.5%      | 0.125   |
| 1/9      | 11.11%     | 0.111   |
| 1/10     | 10%        | 0.1     |
| 1/11     | 9.09%      | 0.0909  |
| 1/12     | 8.33%      | 0.0833  |

From these, you can derive others. For example, if `1/8 = 12.5%`, then `3/8 = 3 * 12.5% = 37.5%`.

### **2. Basic Percentage Calculations**

**Formula:** `x% of y = (x/100) * y`

The trick is to use the fraction equivalent instead.

**Example: Find 25% of 160.**
*   **Slow Method:** `(25/100) * 160 = 0.25 * 160 = 40`.
*   **Fast Method:** We know `25% = 1/4`. So, `(1/4) * 160 = 40`. This is a simple mental calculation.

**Example: Find 16.66% of 120.**
*   **Slow Method:** Trying to calculate with `16.66` is very difficult.
*   **Fast Method:** From our table, we know `16.66% = 1/6`. So, `(1/6) * 120 = 20`.

### **3. Percentage Increase and Decrease**

This concept is about finding a new value after a percentage change or finding the percentage change between two values.

#### **a) Finding the New Value**
A powerful shortcut is the **Multiplying Factor (MF)**.
*   For an **increase** of `x%`, the new value is `(100+x)%` of the original. **MF = `1 + x/100`**.
*   For a **decrease** of `x%`, the new value is `(100-x)%` of the original. **MF = `1 - x/100`**.

**Example: Increase the price of an item costing ₹400 by 15%.**
*   **Slow Method:** `15% of 400 = 60`. New price = `400 + 60 = 460`.
*   **Fast Method (MF):** 15% increase means MF = `1.15`. New price = `400 * 1.15 = 460`.

#### **b) Finding the Percentage Change**
**Formula:** `Percentage Change = [ (Final Value - Initial Value) / Initial Value ] * 100%`
*   **Important:** The denominator is always the **initial** or **base** value.

**Example: A student's score went from 60 to 75. Find the percentage increase.**
*   `Change = (75 - 60) / 60 * 100%`
*   `= (15 / 60) * 100%`
*   `= (1/4) * 100% = 25%`

### **4. Successive Percentage Change**

This applies when a value is changed multiple times consecutively.

**Formula:** If a value is first changed by `x%` and then by `y%`, the net percentage change is:
`Net % Change = x + y + (xy / 100)`
(Use `+` for increase and `-` for decrease).

**Example: The price of an item is first increased by 20% and then decreased by 10%. What is the net change?**
*   Here, `x = +20` and `y = -10`.
*   `Net % Change = 20 + (-10) + (20 * -10) / 100`
*   `= 10 + (-200 / 100)`
*   `= 10 - 2 = 8%`.
*   The result is positive, so it's a net **8% increase**.

> **Quick Question:** The length of a rectangle is increased by 10% and its breadth is decreased by 10%. What is the net change in its area?
> **Answer:** `x=+10`, `y=-10`. Net change = `10 - 10 + (10 * -10)/100 = 0 - 1 = -1%`. The area decreases by 1%.

### **Topic Summary & Revision**

*   **Fraction Equivalents:** Your most powerful tool. Memorize the table.
*   **x% of y:** Think in fractions. `37.5% of 80` is `3/8 of 80 = 30`.
*   **Percentage Change:** Always divide by the **initial value**.
*   **Multiplying Factor:** For increases and decreases, multiply by `1 ± (x/100)`.
*   **Successive Change:** Use the formula `x + y + (xy/100)`.

    - [ ] 120
    - [ ] 150
    - [ ] 200
    <br>

**Answer Key:**
1.  **C**: ||60% is 3/5. (3/5) * 250 = 3 \* 50 = 150.||
<br>
2.  **B**: ||An increase of 25% means the new number is 125% (or 5/4) of the original. Let the original be N. N * (5/4) = 300. So, N = 300 \* (4/5) = 60 \* 4 = 240.||
<br>
3.  **B**: ||(45 / 75) * 100%. Simplify the fraction: 45/75 = 3/5. We know 3/5 is 60%.||
<br>
4.  **B**: ||The 20% reduction in price for ₹100 means a saving of 20% of 100 = ₹20. This saving of ₹20 allows the person to buy 5 kg more. So, the new (reduced) price is ₹20 / 5 kg = ₹4 per kg. This is the price after a 20% reduction. If the original price is P, then P * 0.80 = 4. So, P = 4 / 0.8 = 5. The original price was ₹5 per kg.||
<br>
5.  **C**: ||This is a classic trap. Let B's salary be 100. Then A's salary is 120. The question asks how much B is less than A. The difference is 20. The base for comparison is A's salary (120). Percentage = (20 / 120) * 100% = (1/6) \* 100% = 16.66%.||
<br>
6.  **C**: ||Using the successive change formula: x = +10, y = -10. Net change = 10 - 10 + (10 * -10) / 100 = 0 - 1 = -1%. A 1% decrease.||
<br>
7.  **B**: ||Total votes = 7500. Invalid votes = 20% of 7500 = 1500. Valid votes = 7500 - 1500 = 6000. Winning candidate got 55% of valid votes. The other candidate got 100% - 55% = 45% of valid votes. Votes for other candidate = 45% of 6000 = (45/100) * 6000 = 45 \* 60 = 2700.||
<br>
8.  **C**: ||Passing marks = 40%. The student got 178 but needed 22 more to pass. So, passing marks = 178 + 22 = 200. If 40% of Maximum Marks = 200, then 0.40 * M = 200. So, M = 200 / 0.4 = 500.||
<br>
9.  **D**: ||Use successive change twice. First, for -20% and -15%: (-20) + (-15) + ((-20)\*(-15))/100 = -35 + 300/100 = -35 + 3 = -32%. Now, combine this -32% with the -10%: (-32) + (-10) + ((-32)*(-10))/100 = -42 + 320/100 = -42 + 3.2 = -38.8%. A 38.8% decrease.||
<br>
10. **A**: ||Let total students be T. Boys = 60% of T. Remaining = 40% of T. Of this remaining part, Girls = 25% of (40% of T) = 0.25 \* 0.40 \* T = 0.10 \* T or 10% of T. The rest are unclassified, which is 100% - 25% = 75% of the remaining part. So, Unclassified = 75% of (40% of T) = 0.75 \* 0.40 \* T = 0.30 \* T or 30% of T. We are given that 30% of T is 30. So, 0.30 * T = 30, which means T = 100.||
