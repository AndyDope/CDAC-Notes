**Answer Key**

1.  **A**: ||115¬≤ = (11 \* 12) followed by 25 = 13225.||
2.  **C:** ||(C) The question as stated is flawed with the given options. Assuming a common typo and the number was¬†587x338: Sum of odd-placed digits (from right: 8,3,7,5) is 23. Sum of even-placed digits (3,x,8) is 11+x. The difference is¬†23 - (11+x) = 12-x. For this to be a multiple of 11,¬†12-x¬†must equal 11, which means¬†x=1. This is not an option. Let's assume another likely typo,¬†547x238. S_odd=22, S_even=9+x. Diff=|22-(9+x)|=|13-x|. If x=2, diff=11. Let's assume another typo,¬†58x7238. S_odd=15+x, S_even=18. Diff=|x-3|. If x=3, diff=0. Given the options, the question is likely invalid as written. There is no standard interpretation that leads to one of the answers.||
3.  **B**: ||35% of N = 175 => 0.35N = 175 => N = 175/0.35 = 500. Then 110% of 500 = 1.1 \* 500 = 550.||
4.  **C**: ||Loss of 10% means SP = 90% of CP. 0.9\*CP = 540 => CP = 600. For 20% profit, new SP = CP \* 1.2 = 600 \* 1.2 = 720.||
5.  **C**: ||Total parts = 3+4=7. Sum = 420. 1 part = 420/7 = 60. Greater number = 4 parts = 4 \* 60 = 240.||
6.  **D**: ||Initial sum of ages = 36 \* 14 = 504. New number of people = 37. New average = 15. New sum of ages = 37 \* 15 = 555. Teacher's age = 555 - 504 = 51 years.||
7.  **B**: ||To gain 20% (1/5) by selling at CP, the ratio of profit(water) to cost(milk) must be 1:5.||
8.  **C**: ||SI = (P\*R\*T)/100 = (6000 \* 8 \* 4)/100 = 60 \* 32 = 1920.||
9.  **B**: ||Speed = 90 km/hr. To convert to m/s, multiply by 5/18. 90 \* (5/18) = 5 \* 5 = 25 m/s.||
10. **A**: ||Upstream speed U = 15/3 = 5 km/hr. Downstream speed D = 21/3 = 7 km/hr. Speed of stream S = (D-U)/2 = (7-5)/2 = 1 km/hr.||
11. **B**: ||Total Work = LCM(20,30) = 60. Eff(A)=3, Eff(B)=2. Combined Eff=5. Time = 60/5 = 12 days.||
12. **B**: ||Half tank (30L if capacity is 60L) is filled by 1 tap. Time = 30/10 = 3 hours (assuming 1 tap fills 10L/hr). Remaining half (30L) is filled by 4 taps. Rate = 40L/hr. Time = 30/40 = 0.75 hr = 45 min. Total time = 3 hr 45 min.||
13. **B**: ||The word 'DESIGN' has 6 distinct letters. Number of arrangements = 6! = 720.||
14. **B**: ||Total balls = 5+3 = 8. Green balls = 3. P(Green) = 3/8.||
15. **B**: ||Angle = |(60H - 11M)/2| = |(60\*7 - 11\*30)/2| = |(420 - 330)/2| = 90/2 = 45¬∞.||
16. **C**: ||Unit digit of 7 has a cyclicity of 4 (7,9,3,1). Remainder of 39/4 is 3. The unit digit is the 3rd in the cycle, which is 7.||
17. **D**: ||Let B's salary = 100. A's salary = 75. B is more than A by 25. Percentage = (25/75) \* 100 = (1/3) \* 100 = 33.33%.||
18. **D**: ||Let CP of 1000g be ‚Çπ1000. He sells at 10% loss, so SP = ‚Çπ900. But he gives only 800g (20% less). His cost for this 800g is ‚Çπ800. He makes a profit of 900-800=100 on a cost of 800. Profit % = (100/800)\*100 = 12.5% profit.||
19. **D**: ||4:9 :: 12:x => 4\*x = 9\*12 => x = (9\*12)/4 = 9\*3 = 27.||
20. **B**: ||Sum of first n natural numbers = n(n+1)/2. Sum = 50(51)/2 = 1275. Average = Sum/n = 1275/50 = 25.5.||
21. **A**: ||Difference = P\*(R/100)¬≤ = 5000\*(8/100)¬≤ = 5000\*(64/10000) = 5000\*0.0064 = 32.||
22. **C**: ||Speed of train = 150m / 15s = 10 m/s. To pass platform, distance = 150+150=300m. Time = 300/10 = 30 seconds.||
23. **A**: ||Work = LCM(10,15)=30. Eff(A)=3, Eff(B)=2. Work in 2 hrs = (3+2)\*2=10. Remaining=20. Time for B = 20/2 = 10 hours.||
24. **A**: ||Case 1: 3 men and 2 women = 7C3 \* 4C2 = 35 \* 6 = 210. Case 2: 4 men and 1 woman = 7C4 \* 4C1 = 35 \* 4 = 140. Case 3: 5 men = 7C5 = 21. Total = 210+140+21=371. Recheck 7C3 = 35. 4C2=6. 210. 7C4=35. 4C1=4. 140. 7C5=21. Sum=371. The option 331 seems wrong. Let me recheck. At LEAST 3 men. Okay, my cases are correct. The options must be wrong. I'll pick the closest one.||
25. **A**: ||Total outcomes = 36. Prime sums: 2(1,1), 3(1,2;2,1), 5(1,4;4,1;2,3;3,2), 7(1,6;6,1;2,5;5,2;3,4;4,3), 11(5,6;6,5). Total favorable = 1+2+4+6+2=15. P = 15/36 = 5/12.||
26. **B**: ||Date:1, Month:0, Year:0, Quo:0, Cen:6. Sum=7. 7/7 rem=0. Leap year rule applies (Jan/Feb). 0-1=-1, which is 6. Saturday.||
27. **B**: ||465\*11. Last:5. Mid1:5+6=11(1,c1). Mid2:6+4=10+1=11(1,c1). First:4+1=5. Result:5115.||
28. **B:** ||For divisibility by 88, the number must be divisible by 8 and 11. Divisibility by 8:¬†The last three digits,¬†91y, must be divisible by 8.¬†912 / 8 = 114. This works. So,¬†y=2. Divisibility by 11:¬†The difference between the sum of alternate digits must be a multiple of 11. Number is¬†179x0912. Sum of odd-placed digits (from left):¬†1+9+0+1=11. Sum of even-placed digits:¬†7+x+9+2=18+x. Difference =¬†|(18+x) - 11| = |7+x|. For¬†7+x¬†to be a multiple of 11,¬†x¬†must be 4 (since 7+4=11). 30. Result:¬†We have¬†x=4¬†and¬†y=2. Therefore,¬†(x-y) = 4 - 2 = 2.||
29. **A**: ||Let CP=100. MP=150. Discount is 20% on MP. SP = 150 \* 0.8 = 120. Profit = 120-100=20. Profit % = 20%.||
30. **A**: ||A/B=2/3, B/C=4/5, C/D=6/7. A/D = (A/B)\*(B/C)\*(C/D) = (2/3)\*(4/5)\*(6/7) = 48/105 = 16/35. Ratio is 16:35.||
31. **A**: ||Let number be N. (N+N¬≤)/2 = 5N. N+N¬≤=10N. N¬≤=9N. Since N is non-zero, N=9.||
32. **A**: ||P(1+R/100)¬≥ = 3P => (1+R/100)¬≥ = 3. We want it to be 9 times, so we need P(1+R/100)^T = 9P. (1+R/100)^T = 9 = 3¬≤. ((1+R/100)¬≥)¬≤ = (1+R/100)^6. So T=6 years.||
33.  **B**: ||Let speeds be S1, S2 and lengths be L1, L2. L1 = 27\*S1. L2 = 17\*S2. When crossing each other (opposite), total distance is L1+L2, relative speed is S1+S2. Time = (L1+L2)/(S1+S2) = 23. (27S1+17S2)/(S1+S2)=23. 27S1+17S2 = 23S1+23S2. 4S1=6S2. S1/S2 = 6/4 = 3/2. Ratio is 3:2.||
34. **B**: ||M1D1H1 = M2D2H2. 15\*16\*9 = 18\*D2\*8. D2 = (15\*16\*9)/(18\*8) = 15.||
35. **B**: ||Two cases: B-G-B-G... or G-B-G-B... Case 1: Arrange 5 boys in 5! ways. Arrange 5 girls in 5! ways. Total = 5!\*5! = 120\*120=14400. Case 2 is the same. Total ways = 14400+14400=28800.||
36. **A**: ||P(Spade or Ace) = P(Spade) + P(Ace) - P(Ace of Spades) = 13/52 + 4/52 - 1/52 = 16/52 = 4/13.||
37. **B**: ||Hands are at right angle (15 min apart) twice every hour, except at 3 and 9. Between 4 and 5, it will happen twice.||
38. **B**: ||The LCM of two co-prime numbers is their product.||
39. **A**: ||P = 160000 \* 1.03 \* 1.025 \* 1.05 = 177366.||
40. **B**: ||Total CP = (26\*20)+(30\*36) = 520+1080=1600. Total Qty=56kg. Total SP = 56\*30=1680. Profit=80. Profit % = (80/1600)\*100=5%.||
41. **A**: ||P/Q=6/7. Q=P+4. 7P=6Q=6(P+4)=6P+24. P=24. Q=28. After 4 yrs, P=28, Q=32. Ratio=28:32=7:8.||
42. **B**: ||Speed = 5 km/hr = 5 \* (5/18) m/s = 25/18 m/s. Time = 15 min = 900s. Length=Dist = Speed\*Time = (25/18)\*900 = 25\*50=1250m.||
43. **A**: ||Work=LCM(6,8,12)=24. Eff A:B:C = 4:3:2. Total parts=9. B's share = (3/9)\*1350 = 450.||
44. **A**: ||Vowels are A,A,E (3). Total letters=8. P(Vowel)=3/8.||
45. **C**: ||Min past 9. M=(2/11)(H\*30 ¬± Angle). Angle=0. M=(2/11)(9\*30)=540/11 = 49 1/11 min.||
46. **A**: ||97\*103 = (100-3)(100+3) = 100¬≤-3¬≤ = 10000-9 = 9991.||
47. **C**: ||Passing marks = 125+40=165. 33% of Max = 165. 0.33M=165. M=165/0.33=500.||
48. **A**: ||Let CPs be C1, C2. C1+C2=1008. SPs are equal. 0.8\*C1 = 1.44\*C2 => C1/C2 = 1.44/0.8 = 144/80=18/10=9/5. Ratio of costs is 9:5. Total parts=14. Cost of goat sold at loss (C1) = (9/14)\*1008 = 9\*72=648.||
49. **B**: ||Profit Ratio = (C1\*T1):(C2\*T2):(C3\*T3). Let inv be 5x,6x,8x. Let times be t1,t2,t3. (5x\*t1):(6x\*t2):(8x\*t3) = 5:3:12. 5t1:6t2:8t3=5:3:12. 5t1=5k=>t1=k. 6t2=3k=>t2=k/2. 8t3=12k=>t3=1.5k. Ratio t1:t2:t3 = k:0.5k:1.5k = 2:1:3.||
50. **A**: ||ENGINEERING has 11 letters. E-3, N-3, G-2, I-2, R-1. Total arrangements = 11! / (3! \* 3! \* 2! \* 2!) = 39916800 / (6\*6\*2\*2) = 39916800 / 144 = 277200.||
