### **Quantitative Aptitude | Chapter 8: Simple Interest and Compound Interest**

Welcome to Chapter 8. This is another critical topic built upon the foundations of [[Aptitude Chapter 3 - Percentage|Percentage]]. Simple Interest (SI) and Compound Interest (CI) are used to calculate the interest earned on a sum of money over a period of time. Understanding the fundamental difference between how SI and CI are calculated is the key to mastering this chapter.

### **1. Core Terminology**

*   **Principal (P):** The original sum of money borrowed or lent.
*   **Interest (I):** The extra money paid for using the principal.
*   **Time (T):** The duration for which the money is borrowed or lent, usually in years.
*   **Rate of Interest (R):** The interest on ₹100 for one year, expressed as a percentage (e.g., 10% per annum).
*   **Amount (A):** The total sum to be paid back at the end of the time period. `Amount = Principal + Interest`.

---

### **2. Simple Interest (SI)**

Simple Interest is calculated **only on the original principal** for the entire time period. The interest earned each year is the same.

**Formulas:**
1.  `SI = (P × R × T) / 100`
2.  `Amount = P + SI = P + (P × R × T) / 100 = P * (1 + (RT/100))`

**Example: Find the simple interest on ₹5000 for 3 years at a rate of 8% per annum.**
*   P = 5000, R = 8, T = 3.
*   `SI = (5000 * 8 * 3) / 100`
*   `= 50 * 8 * 3 = 1200`.
*   The simple interest is ₹1200.

**Conceptual Approach:**
Interest for one year = `8% of 5000 = 400`.
Interest for three years = `400 \* 3 = ₹1200`.

---

### **3. Compound Interest (CI)**

Compound Interest is calculated on the **principal plus the accumulated interest** from previous periods. This is often called "interest on interest."

**Formulas:**
1.  `Amount (A) = P * (1 + R/100)^T`
2.  `CI = Amount - Principal = P * [ (1 + R/100)^T - 1 ]`

**Compounding Frequency:**
Sometimes, interest is compounded more than once a year.
*   **Half-yearly (Semi-annually):** Rate becomes `R/2`, Time becomes `2T`.
*   **Quarterly:** Rate becomes `R/4`, Time becomes `4T`.
*   **Monthly:** Rate becomes `R/12`, Time becomes `12T`.

**Example: Find the compound interest on ₹5000 for 2 years at 10% per annum.**
*   P = 5000, R = 10, T = 2.
*   `Amount = 5000 \* (1 + 10/100)²`
*   `= 5000 \* (1.1)²`
*   `= 5000 \* 1.21 = ₹6050`.
*   `CI = Amount - P = 6050 - 5000 = ₹1050`.

**Conceptual Approach (Successive Percentage Change):**
This is often faster than the formula. A 10% increase each year for 2 years.
*   **Year 1 Interest:** `10% of 5000 = ₹500`. New Principal = 5500.
*   **Year 2 Interest:** `10% of 5500 = ₹550`.
*   **Total CI:** `500 + 550 = ₹1050`.

The net percentage increase for two years at 10% is `10 + 10 + (10\*10)/100 = 21%`.
Total CI = `21% of 5000 = ₹1050`.

### **4. Difference Between CI and SI**

A very common question type involves the difference between CI and SI for a given period.

*   For the **first year**, `CI = SI`.
*   The difference arises from the **second year onwards** because CI starts calculating interest on the first year's interest.

**Formulas for the Difference:**
*   **For 2 years:** `Difference = P * (R/100)²`
*   **For 3 years:** `Difference = P * (R/100)² * (300 + R)/100`

**Example: Find the difference between CI and SI on ₹8000 for 2 years at 5% per annum.**
*   P = 8000, R = 5, T = 2.
*   `Difference = 8000 * (5/100)²`
*   `= 8000 * (1/20)²`
*   `= 8000 * (1/400) = 20`.
*   The difference is ₹20.

### **Topic Summary & Revision**

*   **SI vs CI:** SI is calculated on the original principal only. CI is calculated on the principal + accumulated interest.
*   **SI Calculation:** `(P\*R\*T)/100`. The interest is the same every year.
*   **CI Calculation:** Use the successive percentage change concept for 2 or 3 years. For longer periods or complex rates, use the formula `A = P \* (1+R/100)^T`.
*   **Compounding Frequency:** Adjust R and T accordingly. For half-yearly, halve the rate and double the time.
*   **Difference Formulas:** Memorize the `P\*(R/100)²` formula for the 2-year difference; it is a very common shortcut.

**Answer Key**
1.  **B**: ||SI = (1200 \* 5 \* 4) / 100 = 12 \* 20 = ₹240.||
2.  **C**: ||To double means the Interest earned equals the Principal (I=P). SI = (P\*R\*T)/100 => P = (P\*R\*8)/100 => 1 = 8R/100 => R = 100/8 = 12.5%.||
3.  **A**: ||Compounded quarterly: Rate R becomes 20/4 = 5% per quarter. Time T becomes 9 months = 3 quarters. Amount = 16000 \* (1 + 5/100)³ = 16000 \* (21/20)³ = 16000 \* (9261/8000) = 2 \* 9261 = 18522. CI = 18522 - 16000 = ₹2522.||
4.  **C**: ||Using the formula for 2 years: Difference = P \* (R/100)². 40 = P \* (10/100)² = P \* (1/10)² = P/100. So, P = 40 \* 100 = ₹4000.||
5.  **B**: ||To triple means Interest earned = 2 \* Principal (I=2P). SI = (P\*R\*T)/100 => 2P = (P\*R\*16)/100 => 2 = 16R/100 => R = 200/16 = 100/8 = 12.5%.||
6.  **A**: ||A/P = 13230 / 12000 = 1323 / 1200 = 441 / 400. We have A/P = (1+R/100)^T. So, (1+R/100)² = 441/400. Taking the square root: 1+R/100 = 21/20. R/100 = 21/20 - 1 = 1/20. R = 100/20 = 5%.||
7.  **D**: ||Interest for (8-5) = 3 years is 12005 - 9800 = ₹2205. SI for 1 year = 2205 / 3 = ₹735. To find the principal, subtract 5 years' interest from the amount after 5 years. Principal = 9800 - (5 \* 735) = 9800 - 3675 = ₹6125. Rate = (SI for 1 year / Principal) \* 100 = (735 / 6125) \* 100 = 12%.||
8.  **C**: ||SI for 2 years = ₹40, so SI for 1 year = ₹20. CI for 2 years = ₹40.80. The difference is ₹0.80. This difference is the interest earned on the first year's interest. So, ₹0.80 is the interest on ₹20 for 1 year. Rate = (0.80 / 20) \* 100 = 80/20 = 4%.||
9.  **B**: ||This is an installment problem. Let each installment be x. The present worth of the installments must equal the loan amount. Present Worth = x/(1+R/100) + x/(1+R/100)². 2550 = x/(1.04) + x/(1.04)². Let k=1.04. 2550 = (xk + x)/k². 2550 = x(k+1)/k². 2550 = x(2.04)/(1.04)². x = (2550 \* 1.04 \* 1.04) / 2.04. A simpler way: 2550 = x/(26/25) + x/(26/25)² = 25x/26 + 625x/676. 2550 = (650x + 625x)/676 = 1275x/676. x = (2550 \* 676) / 1275 = 2 \* 676 = ₹1352.||
10. **A**: ||Case 1 (Yearly): For 1st year, I = 4% of 5000 = 200. For next 0.5 year, I = (5200 \* 4 \* 0.5)/100 = 104. Total CI = 200 + 104 = ₹304. Case 2 (Half-yearly): Rate = 2% per half-year. Time = 1.5 years = 3 half-years. A = 5000 \* (1.02)³ = 5000 \* 1.061208 = 5306.04. CI = 306.04. Difference = 306.04 - 304 = ₹2.04.||

### **Bonus Tips**

*   **Rule of 72 (for CI):** A quick estimation tool. The number of years it takes for an investment to double is approximately `72 / (Rate of Interest)`. For a 9% interest rate, it would take `72/9 ≈ 8` years to double.
*   **Successive Percentage:** For 2 or 3 years, CI is just a successive percentage increase. Use the formula `x + y + xy/100` for 2 years. For 3 years at 10%, it's not 30%; it's 33.1%. Knowing these common values (`2 years @ 10% = 21%`, `3 years @ 10% = 33.1%`) saves a lot of time.
*   **SI vs CI Difference:** The difference between CI and SI for the 2nd year is simply the interest on the 1st year's interest. In Q8, SI for 1st year is 20. The difference is 0.80. Rate = (0.80/20) \* 100 = 4%. This is much faster than using formulas.
