### **Session 14: Managing Console I/O Operations**

Welcome to Session 14. We've been using `cout <<` and `cin >>` since the very first session, but these are just the tip of the iceberg. The C++ I/O system is a powerful, type-safe, and extensible library built around a hierarchy of stream [[C++ Session 8 - OOP Concepts#1. Classes and Objects|classes]]. Today, we'll dive deeper into how this system works and learn how to format our console output professionally.

#### **1. Introduction to C++ Streams**

A **stream** is a sequence of bytes flowing from a source to a destination. It's an abstraction that allows us to treat different I/O devices (like the console, files, or network sockets) in a uniform way.

*   **Input Stream:** Extracts (reads) bytes from a source (e.g., keyboard).
*   **Output Stream:** Inserts (writes) bytes to a destination (e.g., screen).

This entire system is defined in the `<iostream>` header we've been including since [[C++ Session 1 - Getting Started|Session 1]].

#### **2. C++ Stream Classes and Standard Objects**

The stream library is built on a hierarchy of classes. The most important ones for console I/O are:
*   `istream`: The base class for input operations (like `cin`).
*   `ostream`: The base class for output operations (like `cout`).
*   `iostream`: A class derived via [[C++ Session 10 - Inheritance - extending class#**2. Types of Inheritance**|Multiple Inheritance]] from `istream` and `ostream`, handling both input and output.

C++ provides four predefined stream objects:
*   `cin`: (Console Input) An object of `istream` connected to the standard input device (keyboard).
*   `cout`: (Console Output) An object of `ostream` connected to the standard output device (screen). It is **buffered**, meaning output is collected and sent in chunks.
*   `cerr`: (Console Error) An `ostream` object for unbuffered error output. Output is sent immediately.
*   `clog`: (Console Log) An `ostream` object for buffered error output. Used for logging.

> **Quick Question:** If you need to print an urgent error message that must appear on the screen immediately, even if the program crashes, should you use `cout` or `cerr`?
> **Answer:** `cerr`, because it is unbuffered and writes immediately.

#### **3. Unformatted I/O Operations**

These functions read or write raw bytes without considering data types. They are useful for character-by-character or line-by-line input.

*   **`cin.get()`:** Reads a single character, including whitespace (like space, tab, or newline).
*   **`cin.getline(char* buffer, int size)`:** Reads a sequence of characters into a character array (`buffer`) until it encounters a newline character or has read `size-1` characters. It includes spaces in its input.

**Why is this important?** The standard `cin >> my_string;` operator stops reading at the first whitespace character. `getline` is essential for reading full names or sentences.

**Example:**
```cpp
char name[50];
cout << "Enter your full name: ";
cin.getline(name, 50); // Reads the entire line, including spaces
cout << "Hello, " << name << "!" << endl;
```
*   **`cout.put(char ch)`:** Writes a single character to the output stream.
*   **`cout.write(const char* buffer, int size)`:** Writes a specified number of characters from a buffer.

> **Quick Question:** If you want to read a user's full name (e.g., "Rahul Kumar") into a single variable, which function is more appropriate: `cin >>` or `cin.getline()`?
> **Answer:** `cin.getline()`.

#### **4. Formatted I/O and Manipulators**

Formatted I/O refers to using the stream insertion (`<<`) and extraction (`>>`) operators. These are powerful because they are overloaded for all basic data types.

**Manipulators** are special functions designed to be used with the `<<` and `>>` operators to modify the state of the stream, thus changing the format of the output (or input). To use manipulators that take arguments (like `setw` and `setprecision`), you must include the **`<iomanip>`** header.

**a) Width, Fill, and Alignment**
*   `setw(n)`: Sets the width for the *next* output operation to `n` characters.
*   `left` / `right`: Sets the alignment of the output within the width. `right` is the default.
*   `setfill(c)`: Sets the character `c` to be used for padding when the output is smaller than the set width.

**Example: Creating a formatted table**
```cpp
#include <iomanip> // Don't forget this header!

cout << left; // Set alignment to left for all subsequent outputs
cout << setfill('.'); // Set the fill character

cout << setw(15) << "Item" << setw(10) << "Price" << endl;
cout << setw(15) << "Apples" << setw(10) << 40 << endl;
cout << setw(15) << "Mangoes" << setw(10) << 120 << endl;

// Output:
// Item...........Price.....
// Apples.........40........
// Mangoes........120.......
```

**b) Floating-Point Precision**
*   `setprecision(n)`: Sets the total number of digits (before and after the decimal) to display.
*   `fixed`: Forces output in fixed-point notation (e.g., 123.45). When used, `setprecision` controls the number of digits *after* the decimal point.
*   `scientific`: Forces output in scientific notation (e.g., 1.2345e+02).

**Example:**
```cpp
double pi = 3.14159265;
cout << "Default: " << pi << endl;                   // 3.14159
cout << setprecision(3) << "Precision 3: " << pi << endl; // 3.14
cout << fixed << setprecision(4) << "Fixed: " << pi << endl; // 3.1416
```

> **Quick Question:** Which header file must you include to use manipulators like `setw` and `setprecision`?
> **Answer:** `<iomanip>`.

### **Topic Summary & Revision**

*   **Streams:** A powerful abstraction for handling I/O as a sequence of bytes. Key objects are `cin`, `cout`, `cerr`, and `clog`.
*   **Unformatted I/O:** Functions like `getline()` and `get()` are used to read raw data, including whitespace, which `>>` does not.
*   **Formatted I/O:** Handled by the `<<` and `>>` operators, which are a form of [[C++ Session 11 - Polymorphism#**3. Operator Overloading**|operator overloading]].
*   **Manipulators:** Functions used with I/O operators to control formatting. They can set width (`setw`), alignment (`left`/`right`), precision (`setprecision`), fill characters (`setfill`), and more.
*   **`<iomanip>`:** The header file required for manipulators that take arguments.

### **Bonus Tips**

*   **Viva/Interview Tip:** Be ready to explain why `cin >> str` fails for full names and what the solution is (`getline`). This is a fundamental C++ I/O question that tests practical knowledge.
*   **Exam Tip:** Manipulators are a very common topic. Expect questions that ask you to write a code snippet to produce a specific, table-like formatted output. Practice using `setw`, `left`, `right`, and `setfill`.
*   **Sticky Manipulators:** Be aware that some manipulators are "sticky" (like `left`, `fixed`, `setfill`) and affect all subsequent output until changed. Others, like `setw()`, are "non-sticky" and only apply to the very next item being inserted into the stream.
