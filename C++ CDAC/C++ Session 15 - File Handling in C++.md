### **Session 15: File Handling in C++**

Welcome to Session 15. So far, all our data has been transientâ€”it disappears when the program ends. To store data permanently, we need to use files. C++ provides a powerful set of file I/O classes that work just like the console [[C++ Session 14 - Managing Console IO Operations#**2. C++ Stream Classes and Standard Objects**|streams]] we just learned about, making file handling intuitive and consistent.

---

#### **1. Definition of a File**

A **file** is a collection of related data stored on a secondary storage device, like a hard disk or SSD. From the perspective of our program, we interact with files through file streams, which are very similar to the console streams (`cin` and `cout`).

The core header file for all file operations is **`<fstream>`**.

---

#### **2. File Stream Classes**

The `<fstream>` header provides three main classes for file handling:

*   **`ofstream` (output file stream):** Derived from `ostream`. It is used to create files and **write** data to them.
*   **`ifstream` (input file stream):** Derived from `istream`. It is used to **read** data from existing files.
*   **`fstream`:** Derived from `iostream`. It can be used for both **reading and writing** to the same file.

**Analogy:**
*   `ofstream` is like your pen, used only for writing on paper.
*   `ifstream` is like your eyes, used only for reading the paper.
*   `fstream` is like a pencil with an eraserâ€”you can both write and read/modify.

> **Quick Question:** If you need to write a log of events from your program into a file named `log.txt`, which file stream class would you use?
> **Answer:** `ofstream`.

---

#### **3. Writing to a File (`ofstream`)**

The process involves three steps:
1.  Create an `ofstream` object.
2.  Open the file using the object's `open()` method or directly in the [[C++ Session 9 - Constructors and Destructor#**1. Constructors**|constructor]].
3.  Write to the file using the stream insertion operator (`<<`), just like with `cout`.
4.  Close the file using the `close()` method to save the changes.

**Example: Writing to a file**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream> // Must include this header!
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // 1. Create an ofstream object and open the file
    ofstream outFile("mydata.txt"); 

    // Check if the file opened successfully
    if (!outFile.is_open()) {
        cerr << "Error opening file for writing!" << endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // 2. Write to the file
    string name = "Ravi";
    int age = 25;
    outFile << "Name: " << name << endl;
    outFile << "Age: " << age << endl;

    // 3. Close the file
    outFile.close();

    cout << "Data written to file successfully." << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
*   If `mydata.txt` does not exist, it will be created.
*   If it exists, its contents will be **overwritten** by default.

> **Quick Question:** What function should you call on a file stream object to ensure all data is written and the file is properly saved?
> **Answer:** The `close()` method.

#### **4. Reading from a File (`ifstream`)**

The process is symmetrical to writing:
1.  Create an `ifstream` object.
2.  Open the file.
3.  Read from the file using the stream extraction operator (`>>`) or other methods like `getline()`.
4.  Close the file.

**Example: Reading from `mydata.txt`**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // 1. Create an ifstream object and open the file
    ifstream inFile("mydata.txt");

    if (!inFile.is_open()) {
        cerr << "Error opening file for reading!" << endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // 2. Read from the file
    string line;
    cout << "Reading from file:" << endl;
    
    // Read the file line by line until the end
    while (getline(inFile, line)) {
        cout << line << endl;
    }

    // 3. Close the file
    inFile.close();
    
    return 0;
}
```
*   `getline(inFile, line)` is used here to read entire lines, just as we did with `cin`.

> **Quick Question:** How can you check if a file was opened successfully after creating a file stream object?
> **Answer:** By using the `is_open()` method (e.g., `if (myFile.is_open()) { ... }`).

---

#### **5. File Modes**

When opening a file, you can specify a *file mode* to control its behavior. You can combine multiple modes using the `|` (bitwise OR) operator.

| Mode | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `ios::in` | Open for reading (default for `ifstream`). |
| `ios::out` | Open for writing (default for `ofstream`). |
| `ios::app`| **Append mode.** All output is added to the end of the file. |
| `ios::trunc`| **Truncate mode.** If the file exists, its contents are discarded. This is the default behavior for `ofstream` if `app` is not specified. |
| `ios::ate` | "At end." Opens the file and moves the control to the end of the file. |
| `ios::binary` | Opens the file in binary mode (instead of text mode). |

**Example: Appending to a file**
To add new data to a file without deleting the old data, use `ios::app`.

```cpp
// Open the file in output and append mode
ofstream outFile("mydata.txt", ios::out | ios::app); 
// or simply: ofstream outFile("mydata.txt", ios::app);

outFile << "This is new data appended to the file." << endl;
outFile.close();
```

### **Topic Summary & Revision**

*   **`<fstream>`:** The header file required for all C++ file I/O operations.
*   **Core Classes:**
    *   `ofstream`: For writing to files.
    *   `ifstream`: For reading from files.
    *   `fstream`: For both reading and writing.
*   **Basic Operations:**
    1.  Create a stream object and open the file (`myFile.open()` or in the constructor).
    2.  Check if the file is open (`myFile.is_open()`).
    3.  Perform read/write operations using `<<`, `>>`, or `getline()`.
    4.  Close the file (`myFile.close()`).
*   **File Modes:** Special flags like `ios::app` (append) and `ios::binary` that control how the file is opened and used.

### **Bonus Tips**

*   **Viva/Interview Tip:** A key concept is **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)**. File stream objects in C++ follow RAII. If you create a file stream object on the stack (e.g., `ofstream myFile("a.txt");`), its [[C++ Session 9 - Constructors and Destructor#4. Destructor|destructor]] will automatically call `close()` when the object goes out of scope. This is a safe and modern way to handle files, as it ensures they are closed even if an [[C++ Session 13 - Exception Handling|exception]] is thrown.
*   **Exam Tip:** Be prepared for questions that ask you to write a complete program to read data about a student (name, roll, marks) from a file and display it, or vice-versa. Master the `while (getline(inFile, line))` loop for reading.
*   **Lab Tip:** Always, always check if a file was opened successfully using `is_open()`. Attempting to read from or write to a file that failed to open will not crash your program, but it will put the stream into a "fail state" where all subsequent I/O operations will be ignored silently, which can be very difficult to debug.
